        Amman (f)</b></font><p><font size="2" face="Arial">We&#146;d
        never intended on riding in Jordan after entering the
        coutry. Our thinking was that it would make a convenient
        starting point for our venture into Egypt. We also
        thought it more than serendipitous that our friends
        Claire and William would be stopping over here on their
        way to India. With the help of our dear friend Olivier we
        coordinated a rendez-vous in Amman. Arriving in Aqaba we
        found our way to the Crystal Hotel and negotiated a room
        with two enormous beds and windows opening out onto the
        central market. Aside from the size of our nests and the
        welcome letter from the hotel&#146;s general manager the
        centrally located Crystal was completely unremarkable.
        Apparently translated by someone with a sick sense of
        humor the letter declared proudly that his hotel featured
        &quot;widey rooms&quot; and &quot;speacial estrained
        arts&quot;.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">We left too soon to figure
        out what these amenities could possibly be, but are sure
        that someone will appreciate them. Aqaba treated us to a
        wonderful fish dinner, part of which stray cats
        vigorously enjoyed until a mean street urchin burned one
        with his lit cigarette. Our other Aqabese discovery was
        the best chocolate ice cream ever (in the terms of
        Michelin guides &quot;worth a detour&quot;.)</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The next day we made an
        early start of it. We rented a micro agouti car, named it
        Akbar and made our way north to Amman to meet Claire and
        William. Riding along the Red Sea, this time on the
        Jordanian side of the border we began to appreciate our
        trip along the other side. Far less inhabited than the
        Israeli counterpart. Our lunch stop caused quite a
        commotion. We drove through a little village in search of
        something to eat. There was no Burger King or
        McDonald&#146;s so we settled for a little falafel in a
        stand near the bus station. Our presence somehow made the
        shop very popular. Everyone in town with a free moment
        stopped in to buy something and greet us with their best
        English while mischievous Arab boys tried to roll our car
        down the hill.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">We faced many challenges
        to make our next destination. Not the least of which was
        Andy&#146;s desire to stop and have a photo session with
        each camel we passed. (It sparked an idea in me.
        We&#146;ll create an on-line calendar featuring the
        camels of Jordan, Israel and Egypt as a feature on the
        page.) Our biggest barrier to making it to our bathing
        place on the Dead Sea were the numerous check points
        where invariably a surly soldier would demand our
        passports and ask for a ride for someone who was waiting
        with him. Each conversation, no matter how curtly we
        turned down the opportunity to have a passenger, ended
        with &quot;Welcome to Jordan.&quot;</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">When we finally did make
        it to the Dead Sea Rest House I learned why so many
        people carry flasks of fresh water to the beach. The
        eye-full of Dead Sea water dished out the most painful
        stinging sensation I could have imagined. Even knowing
        the risks I can&#146;t stop singing the praises of
        bobbing about in the water feeling the minerals leach out
        the impurities from my skin. In an experiment we tried to
        get the water to dry on us after leaving the water. In
        the desert, where you air-dry from a shower in five
        minutes, it was a surprise to find us still wet after
        nearly half an hour. We finally gave up and rinsed off in
        the outdoor showers where Andrew shrugged off the amorous
        advances of a handsome young Jordanian.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Our car Akbar, showing
        surprising strength for such a small beast, rocketed us
        out of the Dead Sea valley to Amman, where we reached the
        airport in ample time to exchange him for a more refined
        and larger beast well in advance of Claire and
        William&#146;s flight.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Of that meeting and our
        subsequent adventures in Amman and on the road to Petra
        fair William writes:</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><i>Flight RJ116 from Paris
        to Amman&#146;s Queen Alia airport arrived at around 6pm
        local time. We (William and Claire (see France trip
        (Chalonnes sur Loire)) were expecting to take a yellow
        Mercedes service taxi to Downtown Amman to stay at the
        RUM Continental hotel on Basman street &#133; but
        that&#146;s not what happened. A pair of well tanned
        legs, with white socks and dusty black shoes were
        standing behind the aluminum barrier. It was Andrew. Our
        3-day stopover to Jordan had just taken an interesting
        new direction &#133; we certainly needed directions to
        find that hotel in Amman, especially as we found out that
        there are two downtowns - we needed the really deep
        downtown place. Fred was at the wheel and made some
        impressive U turns, one of which got us flagged down by
        some local police. </i></font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><i>After a few left turns
        we found the hotel and decided on an immediate stomach
        update. The Ammanese are very friendly and we found the
        Jerusalem restaurant without too many problems &#133; en
        route we met Sultan (if you&#146;re reading this Sultan
        then hello and thanks). After Jerusalem&#146;s we
        embarked on having a sweet - the expression &#145;Dessert
        Storm&#146; has taken on a whole new meaning - there is a
        remarkably dangerous array of sugary based products for
        sale in this region. The evening was topped off with
        Turkish coffee and backgammon.</i></font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><i>Next day (Thursday 13</i><sup><i>th</i></sup><i>
        November 1997) &#133; breakfast consisted of coffee, pita
        bread, jam and the &quot;La Vache qui rit&quot;
        triangular shaped cheese &#133; then off and out of
        Amman. Full marks to Fred for not having sweaty armpit
        marks on his grey &quot;American Rattlesnake Museum&quot;
        T-Shirt &#133; the driving can be very creative at times.
        We finally found the King&#146;s highway - a very twisty,
        turny mountainous road that cuts through the heart of
        Jordan. First stop was Madaba to explore the mosaics of
        the St.George church - 4 Jordanian Dinars (JDs) later and
        a visit to the archeological museum we carried on
        southwards &#133; towards Petra. Yet another stop from
        the local police at Kerak; this time they wanted to
        hitchhike, in the back of the car.</i></font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><i>Room 303 of the Petra
        Palace hotel looks out at the red neon sign for the
        &#145;Sun Set Hotel&#146; and the bouldery mountain-like
        surface of this 2,600 year old site.</i></font></p>

        (f)</b></font><p><font size="2" face="Arial">If
        you&#146;ve seen the third Indiana Jones movie you have
        had a glance at one of the most astounding sights of
        Petra, the Treasury. Unfortunately you have missed the
        sense of anticipation of walking through the narrow slit
        canyon that leads to it and the awe of its revelation to
        you through the keyhole which is the opening to the site.
        Arriving to the site in the morning you&#146;ll see the
        sun beaming down on it lighting up the wavy red and
        orange hues of the iron impregnated sandstone. What is
        harder to imagine than the beauty facade carved from one
        piece of sandstone is that it is still in tact after over
        2600 years.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">We spent two full days
        wandering around the site and I still feel that I could
        have done it greater justice. The staff at our hotel
        recommended that it would take in excess of two weeks to
        see all of the structures. (This was probably true,
        though they were likely looking to convince us to stay a
        little longer in order to fill some of their empty rooms.
        The area is vastly overbuilt with hotels. Many seemed to
        be staying away with the seemingly imminent threat of war
        between the US and Sadam Hussein&#146;s forces in Iraq.) </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">(Many folks may be staying
        away due to the cost of visiting Petra. A day trip from
        Israel would be exorbitant. The exit tax from Israel is
        56 shekels, entry to Jordan $20-50 (depending on your
        nationality), transportation to and from by bus (who
        knows&#133;.) and finally the entry for one day is nearly
        $30. The locals thinking that anyone who visits must be
        rich if they can afford entry tries to exact as many
        Jordanian Agoutis as they possibly can out of everyone.
        Regardless of the expense it is worth it.)</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Petra is not for the faint
        hearted. Though many of the sights are located in the
        valley and can be accessed by foot, horse, camel or cart,
        a true appreciation is only found by those who venture
        into the steep wadis (canyons). From the plateau
        surrounding the valley, once can survey it from above and
        see the other buildings on high. Some of these hikes
        involve climbs up one thousand or more steps or along
        precariously perched trails. Anyone who meets these risks
        and exerts the effort to climb is richly rewarded with
        views beyond their imagination.</font></p>

        Aqaba (f)</b></font><p><font size="2" face="Arial">Sadly
        we said goodbye to William and Claire wishing them a bon
        voyage to India. We had decided to visit a Bedouin town
        called Wadi Rum in an immense canyon. Our intent was to
        spend the night there in a tent but we were ferociously
        disappointed upon finding this locale to be a horrible
        tourist trap. During our drive through the village we
        were accosted by no fewer than a dozen touts pitching
        jeep trips through the valley. A stop at the rest house
        there revealed that accommodation was not in Bedouin
        tents as promised but in drab olive green army surplus
        canvas jobs. We paid our three agoutis for a cup of
        &quot;Bedouin Coffee&quot; served from a pump thermos and
        hit the road.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Avis had asked us to
        return the car empty, and we managed to get it to their
        lot on fumes. We actually went there twice. Naively Andy
        thought that bringing it back early we&#146;d get some
        sort of discount. In effect we were two hours later than
        we&#146;d picked it up and would be responsible for the
        entire day regardless. We drove to our favorite
        restaurant and had another chocolate ice cream. (see
        above) Getting the bill for something like a rental car
        in the Middle East is seldom a simple experience. This
        day was no exception. Everyone in town seemed to be
        involved in the transaction somehow, including the
        manager&#146;s two-meter and ten-centimeter tall
        basketball playing brother. After an eternity we were
        whisked away to the border to retrieve Siegfried and Roy
        from the bomb shelter.</font></p>
