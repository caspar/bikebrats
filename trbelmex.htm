        <td><font size="2" face="Arial"><strong>Monday, 16
        December 1996, Belize City to Orange Walk, 54 miles</strong></font><p><font size="2" face="Arial">That we began our cycling trip in
        Belize City was largely my mother&#146;s doing. Fred and
        I had been planning to cycle in this part of the world
        for some time when she invited us to accompany her on a
        ten-day ecology-oriented tour. She said she would even
        pay for our plane tickets from Houston, which made the
        offer too good to pass up. And the tour turned out to be
        not at all bad. Our group of fourteen got along overall
        and had its humorous aspects (see Appendix I, with text
        by Fred). Martin, our Belizified Brit guide, was
        amazingly knowledgeable &#150;especially regarding flora
        and fauna-- and we managed to see a sizable chunk of the
        country, plus Tikal in Guatemala. During the first part
        of this tour, the thought of our bicycles waiting for us
        back in Belize City had a decidedly menacing feel to it;
        we would be biking in a strange land for the first time
        and had no idea what to expect. But as the tour wore on,
        the bikes began to represent freedom &#150;freedom from
        the handholding and sheparding, freedom from being
        trapped at a table three times a day with our unlikely
        companions, freedom to ride in any direction we felt
        like. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">We bid adieu to our
        elderly traveling companions (including the incredible
        Sam Adams, who had celebrated his eighty-eighth birthday
        with us two days before) at the San Pedro airstrip on
        Ambergris Key, thrilled to be by ourselves and capable of
        making our own decisions after ten days of being babysat.
        We were reunited with our bikes at around eight a.m., in
        a storage closet of the Fort George Hotel. By the time we
        had changed into our cycling costumes, checked the bikes
        and loaded up the gear, it was later than we would have
        ideally set off in the tropical climate. Even threading
        our way through the confusion of Belize City, we could
        feel the heat. The whole fifty-some miles to Orange Walk
        were pancake flat, against a stiff glancing wind. Also
        slowing us down (sometimes our pace fell below 11mph) was
        the compositish surface of the road. The most striking
        feature of the landscape was its very lack of features:
        monotonous shrubby jungle broken only by the mileage
        markers which regularly remind us of our sluggish pace.
        By the time the clouds finally started to roll in, at
        mile marker 38, I seriously needed a break, and an
        unfinished house in the middle of nothing provided a
        nicely shaded concrete slab on which to rehydrate and
        play backgammon for an hour.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Coming into Orange Walk
        after a seemingly endless day&#146;s riding, we passed a
        sugar refinery belching smoke into the sky. Mile-long
        lines of trucks loaded beyond capacity with sugarcane
        waited their turn, a preview of the sugarcane fields
        through which we&#146;d surely be pedaling the next day.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Orange Walk is your basic
        highwayside shithole of a town that smells and feels like
        some on the smaller towns in Java. We checked into the
        first hotel we came upon, which was spartan but
        comfortable and even had a pool. After chatting with an
        old Austrian couple who had driven there from San
        Francisco (yes, the one in California), we went to the
        pool with postage-stamp sized towels supplied by the
        hotel, only to discover that the water was probably not
        treated in any way, and perhaps not a good idea to swim
        in with all of the blisters and bites we had acquired in
        the jungle.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Our stroll around town was
        more successful. We even spotted a couple of homos
        sitting on a bench in the scruffy plaza. They followed us
        into a nearby bar, but I didn&#146;t notice until we were
        leaving, so we never got the chance to talk to them. At
        the suggestion of Emilio --the owner of the noisy, sleazy
        bar-- and the registrationettes at our hotel, we went for
        an early dinner at Lee&#146;s Chinese Restaurant, which
        proclaimed &quot;the best food in town&quot; on their
        sign. It turned out to be a depressing place with
        uninspired, greasy food. I made the mistake of ordering
        iced coffee, which Fred described as having a
        &quot;Mister Bubble aftertaste.&quot;</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">We went back to our room
        to get a dose of CNN, the only news (or reasonable
        facsimile) we had come across in nearly two weeks. The
        big story was another Clintonian scandal involving his
        legal defense fund. I found myself surprised by the
        apathy I felt towards the stock market news. The road
        ahead took precedence in my thoughts now. I went to bed
        with a new appreciation of the blank spaces on the map,
        satisfied with having officially survived our first day
        on the road, and thinking of the 400 or so kilometers to
        Oxkutzcab, the next town where I knew there was a hotel. </font></p>

        <td><font size="2" face="Arial"><strong>Tuesday, 17
        Deciembre, Orange Walk to Bacalar, 57 miles</strong></font><p><font size="2" face="Arial">We arose at around 5:30 and watched
        the sun rise from the sidewalk tamale stand where we had
        a breakfast nearly as delicious as the beautiful mexiboy
        sitting next to us. It struck us once again how truly
        multicultural Belize is as other customers included
        blacks and Chinese, eating food prepared by a Mexican
        woman. An East Indian dude was also at hand, eager to
        change our dollars into pesos, while severe-looking
        Menonites glared at us disapprovingly from across the
        street.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Our second and last day
        cycling in Belize was far more interesting than the
        first, mostly because there was lots more to look at, and
        the rolling terrain kept our fingers busy shifting gears.
        About ten miles out of Orange Walk we turned onto a dirt
        road, an alternate route to Corozal and the border
        beyond, one that promised less traffic. It was a poorly
        maintained dirt road, yet faster riding than the highway
        due to its relative smoothness. The local monoculture of
        sugarcane became quickly apparent and supplied some shade
        from the surprisingly intense early morning sunshine. Two
        more surprises awaited us outside the sleepy town of
        Libertad, where we stopped for drinks and snacks: a
        swank-looking hotel (named &quot;Santa Cruz&quot;) in the
        middle of nowhere, and a guy on a bike (practically the
        first we&#146;d seen in Belize) holding a baby bird. We
        noticed that the transition to Mexico happened well
        before the border; no one was speaking English anymore,
        and the dominant feature of every village on the paved
        road from Libertad to Corozal was the local tortilla
        factory. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">We followed the beach
        route into Corozal and stopped at the first palapa we saw
        for a session of postcarding. It was too early for lunch,
        but too hot to be in the sun. An odd pair of locals soon
        joined us out of curiosity: Stafford and Laura. They
        worked together as seamstresses nearby. Stafford was the
        queeniest little teenager we had met in some time, and we
        wondered whether he realized yet that he was queer. I got
        him to sew up my blown-out handlebar bag, and then
        Laura&#146;s little brother led us to the post office to
        mail off the last of our cards. Lunch was in a place
        recommended by our seamstress friends, a place run by an
        American (God knows what he was doing in this godforsaken
        place), with good food and a breezy balcony perfect for
        backgammon. At 2:30 or so we reluctantly hit the road
        under a blazing sun. Soon we found ourselves at the
        border, where we encountered the expected bureaucratic
        dance of papers and rubber stamps. A customs officer told
        us that Bacalar, our destination, was 32 kilometers away,
        which sounded a lot easier than it actually was . The sun
        had drained me of all my energy, and it was tough going
        once we hit the main Westward highway out of Chetumal. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The overall first
        impression of Mexico was how orderly it was, and the
        undeniable fact that we were in a large country with a
        mammoth infrastructure, evidenced in the
        &quot;glorieta&quot; at some 10km from the border
        &#150;an enormous traffic circle surrounding a gargantuan
        chunk o&#146; public sculpture.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The second new word du
        jour was &quot;topes&quot; &#150;speed bumps&#151;which
        comprise an integral part of Mexican highway culture.
        Every village is heralded by several sets of topes
        designed to slow down the traffic, and the topes
        themselves are announced with far greater elaboration
        than the actual village. The first sign coming into a
        Mexican village warns: &quot;TOPES 300metros&quot;,
        followed by international-style icons of topes, then:
        &quot;TOPES 200 metros,&quot; etc. The inevitable sign
        &quot;PUEBLADO PROXIMO:&quot; followed by the name of the
        village and the number of its inhabitants, gets lost in
        all the semiotic noise over topes. After several days of
        riding over topes, we came to refer to the more
        characterless villages we passed through as
        &quot;Topetowns.&quot;</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">When we turned northwards
        off the main highway, the truck traffic thinned out
        considerably and the jungle all but swallowed the road,
        thereby providing us with some much-needed shade. Signs
        announcing Bacalar and its topes were met with relief,
        especially with the sun so low in the sky. After ten days
        in Belize, we had learned how quickly it gets dark in
        this part of the world.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Fred started whining a bit
        about wanting to stay in the advertised hotel (which we
        hadn't expected) but I had already made up my mind that
        we ought to be trying camping. And the campsite was right
        there and looking mighty inviting. Besides, it was only
        15 pesos, less than two bucks. We could spend all our
        money on food at the turista-type restaurant next door
        --which is precisely what we did. After setting up camp
        and washing the road gunk off our bodies, we scored a
        table beside the cenote &#150;a round Yucatecan sinkhole
        in which people swim&#151;and watched the sky turn colors
        as we drank our first Mexican beers of the trip. It felt
        pretty good, and I felt happy knowing that this was our
        first-ever night of self-supported cyclo-camping. We
        struck up conversations with some of the people around
        us: a French-Brit hetero couple living in Berlin with
        their high-strung daughter; and a middle-aged American
        professor from Davis living in Cancun who touts duckweed
        as a solution to sewage problems in the developing world.
        The seafood brochettes were delicious, but the waiter
        brazenly tried to rip us off, rounding the bill up from
        135 pesos to an even 200. Perhaps he could tell it was
        our first day in Mexico. I&#146;m still upset that Fred
        tipped him&#133; </font></p>
