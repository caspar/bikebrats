        Prologue (f)</b><p>Picking up the pen, or the keyboard in
        this case, seems difficult after so long a break from
        Brathood. Even worse, writing about events and sentiments
        that were experienced some four or more weeks ago has
        somehow diluted their intensity. I&#146;ll have to
        remember not to wait this long to record things in the
        future. </p>
        <p>Our arrival at the border of Thailand occurred in the
        sweltering heat of the day. We&#146;d ridden some eighty
        or ninety kilometers before lunch and were fatigued and
        hungry as we passed through one of the more casual
        customs and immigrations procedures of the trip. We were
        too hot and tired to continue riding so we sought a ride
        for the final kilometers into Hat Yai. Getting a ride
        proved to be a daunting task; no Thai was willing to
        chuck the BratBikes into the bed of their pickup and haul
        our sorry arses, not to mention our gear. We decided to
        lunch first and then evaluate our options.</p>
        <p>Directly across from the border within the police
        compound there was a very happening little restaurant.
        The proprietor seemed to be a policeman himself. He
        bussed tables and greeted the mainly police clientele in
        uniform and gun while his wife served up lunch. Ours was
        a spicy green curry over rice. Caked with sweat and road
        dirt from the day&#146;s ride, I still needed something
        to cool me down which came in the form of a popsicle
        shaped like a Volkswagen beetle. There was some
        satisfaction to eating the effigy of an automobile.</p>
        <p>Sated by our lunch and my cathartic dessert we went in
        search of a ride to Hat Yai. No one at the border would
        give us the time of day, much less a lift. Compounding
        matters, some little black biting insects seemed to be
        captivated by our flavor, hovering around us nipping at
        our flesh. We were just about to set off by bike in spite
        of our state of exhaustion when two guys with a pickup
        said that they were leaving in a few moments and offered
        to drive us. Once our bikes were safely stowed in the
        back and we were situated in the luxurious bonus cab I
        noticed official looking badges, a police or military
        radio and a large gun in the glove box. I tried to offer
        them some remuneration for their trouble but they
        wouldn&#146;t accept. We reveled in our good travel
        karma.</p>
        <p>Short-lived luck it would be, for a few moments later
        we were back in purgatory at the train station in Hat
        Yai. Our intent was to train up to Bangkok to meet our
        friends and celebrate Andy&#146;s big birthday. At the
        station we learned that it would be well past his happy
        occasion before we could take the train to Bangkok even
        in the worst class of service. There were simply no seats
        to be had. On our way to find a hotel we pondered our
        options and set out to figure out the best way there
        after settling in.</p>
        <p>Neither of had really thought about how we would spend
        our break from riding nor how we would get to the States.
        In fact, I wasn&#146;t at all sure that I&#146;d come
        home for the break. While seeking alternative
        transportation to Bangkok we landed outstanding deals on
        round-trip tickets to Los Angeles and snapped them up. At
        that agency the owner told us of the best way to get to
        Bangkok in lieu of the train. She highly recommended the
        super luxurious VIP 24 overnight bus there.</p>
        <p>Now that we&#146;d settled on a cure for our logistic
        woes we were ready to celebrate. A trip to the mall was
        in order. There we snarfed pizza and ice cream and
        observed the native Thais and Malaysian consumer tourists
        scooping up bargains. It was a novel thing to see actual
        consumption in fiscal crisis ridden Asia.</p>
        <p>A leisurely walk through town took us by a country
        western bar where a Thai band rehearsed a rather tattered
        version of &quot;The Gambler&quot;. We slugged down a
        couple of beers listening to the lead singer stumble on
        the r&#146;s and l&#146;s that dot the lyrics before
        setting down his guitar. On our way back home to our
        hotel we wandered the busy streets lined with vendors
        selling all sorts of wares. A surprising number of shops
        offered the services of women who would cut hair or
        massage you as a prelude to some less pure act. We
        somehow managed to avoid their beckoning. Somewhat later
        in front of our hotel a <i>tuk-tuk</i> (a small
        three-wheeled vehicle, part Vespa scooter, part bus)
        driver offered to take us to a girlie show.</p>
        <p>He grinned when we said boys would be more interesting
        to us, consulted his fellow drivers and whisked us off to
        a bar. It was just ten as we arrived and the place was
        just opening for business. We sat at a table and watched
        the boys arrive for work. Each had a white tee-shirt with
        a red round button with a number on it in order to make
        it easier to make a selection. Neither of us was entirely
        comfortable with the experience but managed to stay
        through a rather stiff (no pun intended) and tame go-go
        boy show that also featured a transvestites. As with all
        TV shows this one was hosted by a rather rotund
        drag-queen with a sharp tongue who made the rounds in the
        audience, embarrassing patrons of the dimly lit bar. We
        narrowly escaped the bar shortly afterwards without the
        company of boys with white shirts and numbers.</p>
        <p>After a day of errands and web publishing we set off
        on our night voyage to Bangkok. The bus was standard
        issue, save that the seats were huge, reclined a long way
        and there were only 24 of them. With only two dozen
        passengers it was easy to find room for our bikes below
        and the driver only exacted a two dollar bribe from us to
        take them. We&#146;d opted to take a public bus instead
        of a private one. We&#146;d been warned that the private
        bus drivers are rewarded for the speed of their trip
        while the public bus drivers didn&#146;t really care how
        long it takes to get there. The choice between a
        white-knuckle ride and a calm slow one seemed obvious to
        us. Still there were many surreal moments during the
        trip. One of which was our dinner stop at a humongous gas
        station cum restaurant. There we watched swarms of
        insects hover around the fluorescent bulbs lighting the
        parking lot while eating our dinner. We were seated at a
        table with the women on the bus, while the men-folk sat
        at another. Somehow they decided that we&#146;d be better
        served in the company of the ladies as opposed to the
        tooth-picking, spitting and smoking men.</p>
        <p>After dinner we settled in for the night and tried to
        sleep the next eight hours to Bangkok. Imagine sleeping
        in a lazy-boy recliner during a 7.9 Richter Scale
        earthquake and you have some idea of the lack of comfort.
        The constant din of horns blowing and jerky movements of
        the mammoth bus weaving in and out of traffic further
        complicated getting a good night&#146;s rest. This would
        be one of the last times I would say to myself, &quot;I
        can do almost anything for 14 hours.&quot; I still
        can&#146;t decide whether I dreamed one incident or
        whether it really happened. I awoke to what I thought was
        the sound of everyone on the bus screaming, the bus
        careening left then right and finally a vacuumey
        sensation of a big truck passing in the opposite
        direction too closely. Andy slept through the entire
        thing whacked on Halcyon and couldn&#146;t confirm or
        deny the event.</p>
        <p>As the sun rose over hazy Bangkok we arrived at the
        largest and busiest bus station I&#146;d ever seen.
        Regardless of our VIP status the bus crew wanted to be
        free of us and fast and were unceremoniously dumping our
        chattels onto the pavement as we exited. Andy felt more
        ready to face the busy Bangkok Bus Station than I and
        went in search of a ride to our hotel. Neither of us were
        feeling composed enough to face rush hour traffic after a
        night of little sleep. He&#146;d found a ride for us in a
        pickup truck. Thank god we are again in a place that is
        civilized, where everyone drives a pickup, not unlike,
        say, Texas. We&#146;d find another commonality between
        Brownsville and Bangkok very shortly.</p>
        <p>As Andy was doing the final haggle for the price of
        our trip to central Sin City I stood across the street
        near the pickup truck guarding our bikes. A few feet from
        me a car stopped in traffic, two men dashed out and
        locked each other&#146;s hands around the other&#146;s
        neck in a death embrace. Three hysterical women flocked
        out of the car crying, screaming and frantically trying
        to separate the two. The big surprise occurred when they
        finally did separate. Then the driver dashed back to the
        car and grabbed his Texas-sized handgun. Brandishing the
        weapon he yelled &quot;mai dai chai lai hoy sem
        lok,&quot; or something to that effect --which most
        likely means &quot;I&#146;m gonna kill you, you
        sonnafabitch&quot;. Fortunately he couldn&#146;t get a
        clean shot at his former companion, decided it
        wasn&#146;t a good idea to shoot into a crowded bus
        terminal or was persuaded by the begging of his womenfolk
        not to fire and retreat to the car.</p>
        <p>While all this was happening I contemplated stepping
        forward and wrestling the gun out of the madman&#146;s
        hand. When I snapped out of this fantasy I found myself
        cowering behind the pickup shouting to Andrew across the
        street to seek shelter in back of something likely to
        take the speed out of a randomly fired bullet. Once back
        in the car with the girls, the man rolled down his
        window, again pointed the gun in the direction of the
        other gentleman and shouted more idle threats. Finally he
        tossed a pair of sunglasses out of the car which left me
        wondering if all that tussle was over eye gear?</p>
        <p>In all our time in Indonesia --which was coming apart
        at the seams financially, politically and socially-- we
        never saw such drama. Only later in the day would we
        learn that we&#146;d left Sumatra just before all hell
        broke loose, the port from which we left had been closed
        and intensive riots began that would soon lead to the
        resignation of their crook-cum-president, Suharto. </p>
        <p>After all of this drama we&#146;d scarcely need a cup
        of coffee to get the &quot;old-juices&quot; flowing;
        nevertheless, my eyelids felt a little heavy as we wove
        through morning Bangkok traffic. The city goes on forever
        and every street is filled curb-to-curb with cars,
        busses, motorbikes and <i>tuk-tuks</i>. A <i>tuk-tuk</i>
        is a hybrid vehicle. One-part Vespa scooter on steroids
        and one-part Indonesian <i>bemo</i>. (For those of you
        who don&#146;t know what a <i>bemo</i> is, it is a
        pick-up truck that is covered and has facing bench seats
        in the bed.) The bravest and most rushed commuters opt to
        take motorbike taxis to their destination. You can only
        imagine the antics of these daredevils.</p>
        <p>Upon our arrival at our rather luxurious accommodation
        the bell staff asked if they could store our bikes and
        for how long. We looked at one another and said
        simultaneously, &quot;three weeks.&quot; Without batting
        an eye they said, &quot;very well then,&quot; and walked
        off with them in a very dignified manner in their
        starched white outfits. Our friend Scott had booked us
        into what seemed to be the best hotel in Bangkok. Named
        after the ancient capital of Thailand, Sukhothai, it was
        filled with treasures old and new. Frankly, the elegance
        of the place was startling after our rather Spartan weeks
        on the road. Most shocking was the buffet breakfast that
        featured the highlights of breakfasts from all
        continents. Andy was most drawn to the <i>pain au
        chocolat</i> and thick European coffee.</p>
        <p>Despite our rather adventurous morning and restless
        night we were amazingly productive. We published the
        website, did our email, got visas for Laos, did yoga with
        Linda on tape, walked around Pat Pong (avoiding touts
        pitching Ping-Pong shows, and they are not talking about
        table tennis) and, most importantly, discovered the seven
        scoops for 99-baht sale at Haagen-Dazs. We even stayed up
        late enough to welcome Ubai and Scott from Indonesia with
        a little excursion into Bangkok&#146;s nighttime
        underworld. We conked out before the duo from Jakarta but
        arose dutifully the next day only to revel again in the
        Sukhothai&#146;s fabulous breakfast. Scott had promised
        to show us &quot;his&quot; Bangkok or at least a little
        taste of it before I sped off to LA for my friend
        Dante&#146;s birthday. It was a tough decision to leave
        Andy to celebrate his alone with Scott and Ubai, but I
        felt he was in good hands. There probably aren&#146;t
        enough adjectives and verbs to describe their
        carryings-on while I flew for the next 18 hours and
        I&#146;ll leave it to Andy&#146;s discretion what to
        share. Rest assured, Scott showed him a good time.</p>
        <p>Back in the US I spent most of my time in a funk,
        missing our trip and wondering why I&#146;d left Asia.
        Make no mistakes, I had a great time celebrating
        Dante&#146;s 40<sup>th</sup>, seeing all of my friends,
        making new ones and visiting with my family. The break
        just seemed badly timed. Part of the problem is that
        I&#146;d agreed to go for a job interview during the
        break. That process got me too close to the mental
        barrier I&#146;d agreed not to cross. Pondering what I
        might do after all of this is done. Andy&#146;s trip home
        was largely spent doting on his lovely son and having fun
        with the rest of his family. They all somehow managed to
        collect in New York --a miracle given the hectic travel
        schedules of that clan.</font></p>

        <td><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Back to Thailand (f)</b><p>I
        never really rested during our time in the States. When
        Andy finally rejoined me in LA and we boarded our flight
        back to Bangkok I was more than relieved to be returning.
        Still, there were a few concerns --not the least of which
        was my right eye. It would look more at home on the
        hunchback of Notre Dame than on me. A clogged oil duct
        had inflamed and infected the upper eyelid to the point
        that it looked like there were two eyeballs under there
        instead of the usual one. Andy kept trying to reassure me
        that no one really would notice, which I found hard to
        believe.</p>
        <p>I knew my eye looked really ugly when even the clerk
        at the Vietnamese Consul&#146;s office was kind to us.
        She agreed to have our visas to us in only three days and
        promised half-heartedly that they would be ready on
        Saturday, and if not then, well at least by Monday.</p>
        <p>Presented with the opportunity to hang out in Bangkok,
        we decided to become tourists. Our first outing was to
        the river for a boat-bus ride up the Chao Phraya. The
        skinny boat barely touched the dock long enough for the
        exiting passengers to jump off and us to jump on before
        gunning its motor and heading to the next stop. Cutting
        through the wakes of the other boats I watched the boat
        flex and twist, looking down its length as we sped to our
        destination. I wondered what it would be like to commute
        like this. </p>
        <p>It wasn&#146;t long after we hopped off the boat that
        we saw the dirtier side of Thai tourism. A very friendly
        guy came up to us and started &quot;helping&quot; us find
        our way about town. He told us that Wat Pho was closed
        for a Buddhist holiday and we were better off going by <i>tuk-tuk</i>
        to the Golden Mountain shrine by way of the Bangkok Trade
        Center and return in time for the re-opening of Wat Pho.
        We could have the whole expedition for just under a
        dollar for both of us. Something smelled. We asked if we
        could just see the shrine and return, but he indicated
        that it was part of the deal to shop at the center. Now
        it became clear, the driver would get some kickback from
        the center if he would bring unsuspecting tourists to the
        shopping area. We declined and carried on to the shrine.
        Miraculously, Wat Pho was open and relatively uncrowded.
        No surprise; most tourists were probably shopping their
        brains out at the Bangkok World Trade Center. The
        highlight of the <i>wat</i> was the whopping 46 meter
        long golden reclining Buddha. There we lit candles and
        incense for our ailing friends. Speaking of injury, I
        managed to burn my right forefinger rather severely
        during this act of charity before we set out for the
        royal palace. Surprisingly, several <i>tuk-tuk</i>
        drivers told us that it too was closed. We became
        somewhat less polite to the World Trade Center hawking
        pests. After walking about the grounds we completed our
        tourist extravaganza by visiting the museum (which was
        also &quot;closed&quot; according to the helpful <i>tuk-tuk</i>
        drivers). The museum was a little tired; it was often
        hard to see the point of many of the intricate dioramas
        through the mammoth dust bunnies forming in the display
        cases. </p>
        <p>On Saturday our visas did indeed come through from
        Hanoi and we were ready to go just as I was becoming
        accustomed to Bangkok. The thought crossed my mind to
        tell Andy that they hadn&#146;t just so I could have a
        wild weekend in the big traffic jam. Instead we packed up
        and checked out of the Sukhothai. The staff at the hotel
        seemed to breathe a collective sigh of relief as we rode
        off on our bikes. They had likely had enough of our bikes
        clogging their baggage room and of our complaints over
        their woefully inadequate phone system (mainly due to the
        incompetence of the operator). The sky darkened and claps
        of thunder rang in the distance as we rode to the train
        station. We soon learned that it was in fact the rainy
        season as we collected a few drops during the last
        kilometer of our ride.</p>
        <p>At the station we found the baggage car and loaded our
        bikes. Our assigned third-class seats were, of course at
        the polar opposite end of the mile-long train, making it
        impossible for us to check on them during the trip and
        leaving us wondering how we could possibly get them off
        at our whistle-stop in Phitsanulok. Seated in front of us
        on the train was a monk who was upset over how much
        overhead baggage space we were taking despite the fact
        that he had but one little briefcase with him. It was
        stuffed full of what looked to be a publication called
        &quot;Monk&#146;s Life&quot; that sported pages and pages
        of catalogs of rare and valuable Buddha images, monk hair
        styles, monk couture, fitness for monks&#133;. Somehow
        the bikes made it safely and we managed to get them both
        off before they inadvertently sped off to Chiang Mai
        without us.</font></p>

        <td><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Phitsanulok (f)</b><p>Waiting
        at the train station was the friend-of-a-friend
        who&#146;d agreed to be our guide in Phitsanulok.
        He&#146;d recently returned from the States after ten
        years there. His parents had convinced him to return to
        run the family Mercedes dealership and bus company after
        the end of a relationship in the LA area. Kosit escorted
        us to our hotel and took us out for a late dinner while
        telling us his life story and making plans for our
        tourist adventure the next day. </p>
        <p>After dinner we examined Phitsanulok&#146;s limited
        Saturday night entertainment opportunities. One seemed
        very curious to us, the flying vegetable. At one
        riverside food stall recently fried vegetables (what the
        Thais call morning glory, similar to Chinese broccoli)
        are hurled fifteen meters horizontally and three meters
        up to a guy who catches them with a plate and then serves
        them to the waiting customers. Not surprisingly there are
        several servings of the UFV&#146;s hanging from the
        nearby electric wires. This is a sport to be taken
        seriously added Kosit, &quot;even the princess has come
        here to catch flying morning glories.&quot;</p>
        <p>On our way to the saddest hotel cocktail lounge
        I&#146;d been to in some time, we made a little detour to
        have a riverside walk. There the excitement of
        Phitsanulok took on an even sadder dimension. Tens of
        people were standing on the bridge and by the riverside
        watching policemen and divers drag the river for a
        drowning victim. Andy became caught up in the whole thing
        and kept demanding that we stay in order to see the body
        extracted from the river. We finally persuaded him to
        leave not before he admitted that he&#146;d be able to
        stay and &quot;watch this sort of thing all night.&quot;
        The cocktail lounge featured a singer that would be more
        at home in a karaoke bar, and after a mai tai there we
        hustled off to our hotel room for a good night&#146;s
        rest.</p>
        <p>The next day we began at the local shrine that houses
        the second most revered seated Buddha in Thailand, the
        first being the misnamed Emerald Buddha in Bangkok
        (misnamed because it is made of jade). While lighting
        candles and incense there I noticed that the burn
        I&#146;d suffered at the reclining Buddha had
        miraculously healed. It was there also in the parking lot
        that Kosit revealed that he wanted to sell the businesses
        and move back to the States or Bangkok. Small town life
        was proving too challenging for him mentally. Case in
        point, at breakfast with us his father showed up and
        joined us. This would not normally be a problem, but
        Kosit&#146;s family does not know of his sexual
        orientation and would likely not latch onto the idea of
        the heir to their businesses being gay.</p>
        <p>Kosit took us to a massive waterfall, huge not in
        height but in volume. We hiked around, discussed our and
        his situation and then returned to Phitsanulok to visit
        the much-touted Buddha casting factory and folk museum.
        It was remarkable to see them casting three meter high
        seated Buddhas that would sell for 96,000 baht once
        covered with gold leaf. (there are 43 baht to the dollar
        at writing). Before leaving us to rest before dinner,
        Kosit helped me satisfy my craving for a traditional Thai
        desert. In the market we purchased sticky rice, mango and
        sweetened coconut milk that I mixed together for my
        afternoon snack. Andy and Kosit also treated me to my
        first actual taste of durian. Heretofore I&#146;d only
        had durian candy and ice cream but not the real McCoy.
        The taste is great but the texture and smell are a little
        much for anyone to take. Most hotels in Asia have signs
        that strictly prohibit guests from bringing the foul
        smelling fruit into their rooms for fear of permanent
        contamination. After a riverside dinner with Kosit we
        said our farewells. Before parting he made sure that we
        had a connection in the next town, a friend from school
        who had also been in exile in the states, Phit Chai
        (pronounced like &quot;pee shy&quot; and meaning
        &quot;older brother&quot; in Thai) </font></p>

        <td><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>8 June, Phitsanulok to
        Sukhothai, 65km, (a)</b><p>Like everywhere else
        we&#146;ve been in Asia, rush hour starts early in the
        Thai hinterland. At six-thirty the streets of Phitsanulok
        were clogged with stinky cars and motorcycles &#150;not a
        bicycle in sight in this prosperous provincial capital.
        The inadequacy of our maps (and our Thai language skills)
        became apparent after only a few minutes on the road. We
        stopped a few times to ask the way, but our inquiries
        were met with blank incomprehension mixed with unmasked
        astonishment. When we came across a big sign marked
        &quot;Sukhothai&quot; &#150;our destination du
        jour&#151;we bit the bullet and followed it back to the
        main road. National Highway 12 is no dream to ride on,
        but it had a wide, paved shoulder and the drivers seemed
        courteous enough. The flat terrain and a decent tailwind
        made the kilometers click off quickly, though the scenery
        was nothing to write home about. Flat rice fields
        stretched in every direction, many of them in the process
        of being plowed by unpicturesque mechanical oxen. As my
        legs did their thing, my brain spent its time
        daydreaming, thinking how Michael in Bangkok (whom we met
        through Scott in Jakarta) had set us up with Kosit in
        Phitsanulok, who had in turn hooked us up with Phit Chai
        in Sukhothai. I wondered if Phit Chai had a homo friend
        in Si Sachanalai (where we&#146;re heading tomorrow), and
        imagined a sort of queer Underground Railroad that would
        provide us a safe haven each night as we headed north.</p>
        <p>We made our destination by ten o&#146;clock, just as
        the temperature was becoming unbearable. It wasn&#146;t
        hard to find our bunker-like hotel, but our Thai sister
        was nowhere to be found. Our dreary surroundings made us
        wonder if we should investigate other lodgings, but we
        saw it best to spend our gay dollar at a gay-run
        establishment, however unsavory it was. In the stifling
        midday heat we wandered through the sleepy town and
        lunched in what has to be Sukhothai&#146;s most upscale
        eatery, a restaurant with beautiful food and a
        commendable attempt at ambience.</p>
        <p>Next door to the restaurant was a clinic, where we
        stopped to have someone look at Fred&#146;s eye problem.
        While Fred was whisked away behind a door from behind
        which children&#146;s screams could be heard, I sat in a
        plastic molded chair, watching Thai teenybopper t.v. All
        around me were other patients waiting&#133;patiently.
        Most of them were old peasants, dressed in worn clothes,
        covered in exotic tattoos, skinny as bamboo and bent over
        from countless days of toiling in the fields. All their
        eyes were glued to the television monitor and I
        couldn&#146;t help but wonder how their minds processed
        such visions of capitalist decadence. Fred eventually
        emerged with a scary patch over his eye, describing
        various tortures inflicted upon him by an evil female
        doctor. To assuage the pain, we treated ourselves to a <i>samlor</i>,
        a pedal-powered taxi. These look a lot like Indonesian <i>becaks,
        </i>only here the driver/pedaler rides in front. Another
        difference is that the first price quoted was so
        reasonable that we didn&#146;t even bother to bargain.</p>
        <p>After a nap we debated how to get out to the
        ruin-filled town of old Sukhothai, first imperial capital
        of the Thais in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries.
        Fred&#146;s drugged state made us opt for a <i>songthaew</i>,
        like an Indonesian <i>bemo</i> but bigger and with a
        passenger compartment made entirely of wood. Once
        arrived, we rented clanky Chinese-style bikes and
        explored the extensive ruins, pausing often under roofs
        or trees to let rain showers pass. While we didn&#146;t
        explore as much as we would have liked, we got a good
        feel for the vastness and serenity of the old city, which
        looks more like a huge tree-filled park. Moats and ponds
        surround numerous temple complexes, among which cows
        graze, monkeys chatter, birds tweet, snakes slither and
        village children play soccer. </p>
        <p>Back in New Sukhothai, we tracked down the elusive
        Phit Chai, whose situation reminded us a lot of
        Kosit&#146;s. Like Kosit, he went to school in Bangkok
        (where the two met) and continued his studies in the
        U.S., where he ended up staying for ten years. A casualty
        of the Asian tradition of filial piety, he moved back
        home two years ago to take over the family business from
        his ailing parents. Now he yearns for the life he had
        back in the States. &quot;Seeing your bikes reminded me
        how I used to do so much back in Hawaii,&quot; he
        lamented in heavily accented English, &quot;I used to go
        biking too, to the beach, to the gym, to the gay bars.
        But here, there&#146;s nothing to do; I just sit here in
        the restaurant and gossip with my staff.&quot; </p>
        <p>Later, I dined with our host while Fred fell into a
        narcotic stupor upstairs. The restaurant had been
        transformed into a kind of nightclub, featuring a sleazy
        and suspect act involving a talentless keyboardist and
        six provocatively-clad singers --five girls and a boy--
        who sang in rotation. An obsequious, stunning-looking
        waiter brought us sad-looking plates of MSG-saturated
        Chinese food. Phit Chai pushed some of this around in his
        plate, and contemplated it with the melancholy expression
        that has essentially frozen into his face. &quot;No one
        really comes here for the food,&quot; he said by way of
        apology, &quot;mostly they come for the
        entertainment.&quot; Just what this last word meant was
        never elucidated, though I suspect that our fabulous
        hotel doubles as a bordello. </p>
        <p>My host was eager to tell me about the queer scene
        &#150;or lack thereof&#151;in his native town: &quot;One
        thing that you have to understand is that the idea of
        &#145;gay&#146; versus &#145;straight&#146; simply
        doesn&#146;t exist in Thailand. Pretty much any guy here
        will go with another guy, or with a girl, or with a <i>katheuw
        </i>&#150;you know, the guys who dress up as girls that
        you see all over Thailand.&quot; At this point Phit Chai
        looked deep into my eyes and said with conviction,
        &quot;I hate <i>katheuw</i>.&quot; This came as somewhat
        of a surprise to me, considering that my host was pushing
        the envelope of masculinity himself. With his dyed,
        permed hair, his unisex outfit, and mincing, sissified
        mannerisms, Phit Chai is hardly butch, and could easily
        be taken for a <i>katheuw</i> in certain lighting
        situations. I suspect that his professed loathing of <i>katheuw</i>
        is really about jealousy. Perhaps Phit Chai would really
        like to go all the way and become a &quot;lady-boy&quot;
        himself, were it not for his social position in the town.
        Another possibility is that the local <i>katheuw</i> get
        more action than he does. Whatever the case, I restrained
        myself from asking, and stuck to safer ground. &quot;Are
        there many <i>katheuw</i> in Sukhothai?&quot; I asked.
        &quot;Oh, lots,&quot; said my fey friend, &quot;would you
        like to see?&quot; With this last, Phit Chai&#146;s eyes
        lit up and I knew I had no choice but to accept his offer
        for a ride around town on his motor scooter. </p>
        <p>&quot;It&#146;s too early, they&#146;re not out
        yet,&quot; he informed me as we slowly puttered across
        the bridge &#150;a lady-boy hangout. When he turned the
        scooter around, I thought he was taking me back to the
        hotel, which he passed saying in a conspiratorial voice,
        &quot;I know another place.&quot; So the town did have a
        gay meeting place after all, even though it was only a
        florist&#146;s shop which doubles as a bar at night.
        Unfortunately, the owner was out of town (in Bangkok, <i>bien
        sur</i>) and no one was about save a few drunken drag
        queens. From here he took me on the loop road north of
        town, where we passed no fewer than three country western
        bars with names like &quot;Boots and Saddle&quot; and
        &quot;Home on the Range.&quot; &quot;Straight
        places,&quot; dismissed my guide, before turning off onto
        a rutted dirt road, upon which he maneuvered his scooter
        with an alarming lack of skill. I&#146;m not sure what he
        was looking for here, but he kept scanning the
        shanty-like houses we passed. At one point we motored by
        a large <i>wat</i> that was a frenzy of activity. In his
        curiously inexpressive monotone, Phit Chai explained,
        &quot;The highest monk here died two days ago and now
        people are coming from all around.&quot; Seconds later we
        were back at the hotel, the tour unceremoniously ended. A
        business card was thrust into my hand, accompanied by a
        vague promise to join us at breakfast. Phit Chai then
        hastily retreated upstairs to his room, like a woodchuck
        to its winter den. </font></p>

        <td><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>9 June, Sukhothai to
        Si Sachanalai, 57km (f)</b><p>Once again we saw the sun
        rise and Phit Chai was nowhere to be seen as we settled
        our breakfast bill and got on our bikes. I was still a
        little woozy from the affair at the doctor&#146;s office
        though my left eye was responding well to her treatment
        and the left looked marginally better. The new casualty
        was my stomach. Her prescription of strong antibiotics
        reduced my digestive tract to a gurgling acidy gorge
        rendering every meal into torture. We thundered down a
        quiet road over rolling hills with the wind at our back.
        The road was not remarkable, mostly passing by vast
        fields of rice paddy. Sukhothai to Si Sachanalai is
        evidently not a very safe place for dogs to travel; we
        saw more roadkill per kilometer (rpk) on this track than
        on any other since Australia.</p>
        <p>We made it to our destination in under three hours,
        rolling up to the information center of Si Sachanalai
        Historical Park at just around 10. The information center
        itself was constructed in cooperation with UNESCO and was
        not really by any convenient entrance to the park. We had
        to take a two-kilometer detour just to find it. Once we
        did find it we were not impressed by the museum or the
        friendliness of the staff. The only person who made eye
        contact with us stood in front of a huge model of the
        site constructed of the materials you would use to build
        a model railroad. With a big wooden stick she pointed out
        things we should see knocking down fake trees and
        relocating temples as she dragged it along the surface of
        the model.</p>
        <p>We stopped at a &quot;resort &quot; and bargained for
        a place to stay and were fleeced. A shabby little hut of
        a room with an air conditioner was nearly twenty bucks a
        night. It was the only real option near the ruins so we
        settled for it. After a long luxurious nap and lunch we
        were biking through the park past pretty spectacular
        ruins of temples and Buddhas. The site was far less
        restored than the previous day&#146;s but they seemed
        somehow more interesting. Perhaps it was because we were
        the only folks in the park. As we entered we caught a
        glimpse of our first elephant. It was galloping through
        the park past a big stupa supported sculptures of
        elephants.</p>
        <p>After a turn around the park including a hike up to
        the top of a 28-meter high stupa, we traveled north along
        the Yom River past more random ruins, huts and smiling
        Thais. One memorable ruin was that of a massive pair of
        pottery kilns shaped like giant zucchini set into a
        little mound. On closer inspection the mound turned out
        to be made mostly of discarded pottery shards. This
        region in Thailand was long known for the quality of its
        pottery and derived revenues from its export. </p>
        <p>As the sun set we pedaled past our hotel and stopped
        at a little restaurant, spending the last moments of the
        day eating while we watched the dusk light play on the
        ruins of a temple and kids kicking soccer balls and
        dreaming of the World Cup.</font></p>

        kingdom&#151;it featured a high Khmer style stupa and a
        massive Buddha statue. We parked our bikes at the
        statue-studded gate leading to the complex, on the
        grounds of a still-functioning <i>wat</i> and next to a
        mentally unbalanced <i>katheuw</i> (Thai drag queen),
        dancing lavishly to the music playing in her head. From
        atop the temple&#146;s lofty stupa we were still able to
        distinguish the smear of scarlet lipstick on her wizened
        face, and her swaying bony limbs jutting out from her
        handmade skirt and blouse &#150;all in all a chilling
        sight.</p>
        <p>After biking past numerous other ancient <i>wats</i>
        outside the old city walls, we once again penetrated the
        heart of the park and sought out the quietest and
        shadiest place we could find for a yoga session. We
        hadn&#146;t gotten very far into our taped routine when a
        pickup truck full of monks pulled up nearby. At first the
        saffron-robed brethren maintained a respectful distance,
        but soon curiosity got the best of them and they
        literally surrounded us, chomping on snacks and
        chattering in excited, amused voices all the while. Now I
        know what a performing seal at the circus feels like. </p>
        <p>A heavy layer of clouds made it possible to ride
        during the middle of the day. As much as we liked the
        laid-back atmosphere of Si Sichanalai &#150;where
        it&#146;s easy to forget you&#146;re living in the
        twentieth century-- we wanted to escape the evil spirits
        at our &quot;resort&quot; and get a taste of a small Thai
        town. Sawan Kholok was on the way to Laos and fit the
        bill nicely. The road there was uninspiring but lined by
        shady trees. The kilometer markers counting down the
        remaining distance to town caught the majority of my
        attention in what could definitely be classified as a
        boring ride. We pulled into town at the apex of the
        day&#146;s heat cycle and were relieved to be offered a
        room with air conditioning. The clock told us it was one
        p.m. &#150;time for a nap.</p>
        <p>When we emerged from our cool cocoon a few hours
        later, we took a stroll around the funky little town,
        through its vast and bustling market and along its gritty
        riverside. The most astonishing thing about Sawan Kholok
        is how virtually all the buildings are made entirely of
        wood, making us wonder what would happen if a fire broke
        out. </font></p>
