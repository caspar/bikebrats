        Arcais, 58 km</b></font><p><font size="2" face="Arial">Our
        days in &quot;port&quot; at La Rochelle were not unlike
        any of our other city stays. A little tourism, no
        bicycling, writing and updating the web. We were struck
        by the beauty of the town and the port and had a picture
        postcard view of the old port, its ramparts and the
        gothic lighthouse. Connecting to AOL to upload our pages
        to CruzIO reminded me of my days working in Eastern
        Europe. Had to disassemble the telephone and wire the
        computer into it because the phones were attached
        directly to the wall. A small price to pay to be able to
        stay in a place with such a view.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">One afternoon while Andrew
        was writing his passage I hit the town to shop for a
        picnic. We wanted something special to go with the
        Mouton-Rothschild we&#146;d bought a few days before. I
        was surprised when our hotelier couldn&#146;t direct me
        to a traiteur (a fancy french delicatessen) nearby. I
        thought a city of this size in France must have one or
        two?! Walking around I stumbled upon the market square.
        It was perfectly preserved with its permanent structure
        of cast iron, brick and glass standing in the center. I
        picked up some fruit, foie gras, smoked sliced duck
        breast, a cannelloni, some tiramisu and a baguette. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">We sat on our balcony and
        gorged ourselves on the meal and the view. While we ate
        the tide receded at an alarming rate. I wish I&#146;d had
        the presence of mind to take a before and after
        photograph. Within 30 minutes the little harbor below us
        was nearly emptied of water. Earlier we were wondering
        why there were so few boats and so few moorings. Our
        answer came as we saw that there was more sand than sea
        at low tide. Now we understood why there was a lock at
        the entry of the other little harbor which held its water
        level 25&#146; higher at low tide.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">We went to a sad little
        bar after dinner that night. The guide pitched
        &quot;ambiance techno&quot;, but &quot;ambiance
        triste&quot; probably fits better. Five sourfaced frogs
        sat quietly drinking beers in barstools that promoted bad
        posture. Perhaps it was too early, after all the sun had
        just set an hour and a half ago (it was nearly 11:30) and
        it was Tuesday night.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">On Wednesday we had a very
        late start. Andy and I went to the market square for
        breakfast and were surprised along the way how quiet it
        was in the downtown area. We stopped to ask someone the
        time fearing we had gotten up too early. It was a few
        minutes before nine, not so early. As we came closer to
        the square things heated up. It was market day. All of
        the vendors from the country side had set up their stands
        in the square, along a road that led to a canal and in
        parking lots. After snarfing down a couple of pastries we
        went in search of fresh squeezed orange juice in the
        market having tired of the terrible canned stuff. No
        luck, but we did manage to find some bottled grapefruit
        juice. Becoming comatose it was time to find some coffee.
        Stopped into a café accustomed to serving the workers of
        the market the barkeep was gossiping with her girlfriend,
        a butcher and a vegetable clerk. She was clearly a
        lesbian, dressed far more butchly than the french boys
        and her display of her teddy bear in a leather jacket was
        a dead giveaway. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Returning to the Hotel
        after our outing it was difficult to get started.
        We&#146;d grown complacent after only a day&#146;s rest.
        Watching the wind whip the flags of the harbor against
        the direction of our intended travel did not help
        motivate us. We packed our bags and I put the telephone
        back together and we hit the road. We began our day along
        a canal with a bike path the sun beaming and the wind
        bearing down on us. Tough riding, but glorious to feel
        warm and see the sun. Stopped a few kilometers down the
        road to assemble a little picnic and sat down to eat it
        at a war memorial in apark. Just as I was smearing goat
        cheese on my baguette some goofy germans wanted us to
        move so they could photograph the monument. Strange, not
        only because they lost the war, but because it was such a
        bad idea for a photo.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The winds picked up even
        further after lunch and we were happy when the road would
        be protected by a hedge or building for a few yards so we
        could pedal in peace. Those moments were few and far
        between for most of the day was spent riding through open
        fields of spring wheat. I had an epiphany while staring
        out into a field watching it wave and swirl in the wind
        like the pelt of a furry animal. The wind blowing the
        fields of grain evoked the brush strokes of Van Gogh and
        left me wondering whether life was imitating art or vice
        versa.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Riding into a little town
        we stopped at a little bar/café and watched a video
        game&#146;s demonstration loop while sipping an Orangina.
        It was called something like &quot;Rage in San
        Francisco&quot;, an automobile race, it sat unused. The
        graphics were amazing, had nothing like that in the
        arcade when we were kids. Behind the bar was a pencil
        drawing of a very ugly dude with the word
        &quot;Wanted&quot; above and &quot;Patou&quot; below.
        Just as we spun around to ask the barmaid who was Patou
        we saw him just behind her. Seated at a table, chin in
        hand was the dwarf smiling at us. &quot;Is Patou the boss
        around here?&quot;, we asked. She answered, &quot;yes, in
        a way.&quot; While she ironed table linen and asked us
        questions about our journey he would grunt a few
        unintelligible syllables, sounding more duck than human,
        and she would reply sweetly to him. We couldn&#146;t
        understand his language but she could. It was good to see
        a handicapped person in france outside of a home where
        they normally hide them away.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Later we were riding along
        and saw in a distant field kites dancing above the wheat.
        On a whim we decided to divert towards them and watch for
        a few moments. Watching someone entertained by the wind
        seemed a great diversion from it. Five kids sat in the
        field flying three kites. They were the fancy kind with
        two strings that make it easy to navigate the kite into
        doing loops, dives and swoopy turns. The kites more
        interesting than the video game we saw earlier in the
        bar. We were just a few yards behind them having a snack
        and some water watching their show. They&#146;d look back
        at us curiously but never approached us. It was at that
        moment that I realized I missed the curiosity of the kids
        in the states. Almost everywhere we would stop we&#146;d
        have kids asking us a hundred questions about us and our
        journey. French kids were just not conditioned to do so.
        They&#146;d stare but keep their distance and curiosity
        to themselves. Adults too keep their questions guarded
        and stare at us in amazement as we pass. The look at us
        like we are some strange invaders, a perplexing new
        technology, marauders or some combination of the three.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Soon we came across the
        Venise Vert (green Venice), the swampy region that was
        our goal for the day. The low-lying terrain criss-crossed
        with canals. We had begun the day along canals and now we
        were ending it beside them as well. We stopped at the
        tourist office in Arcais to find out about our lodging
        opportunities and the sour-pussed clerk nearly beheaded
        us when we asked her for some advice right in front of a
        sign that said &quot;l&#146;acceuil est le sourire de la
        France&quot; (the welcome is France&#146;s smile.) Seemed
        a poor excuse for the lack of real smiles in France. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Arriving a few moments
        later at the gite (bed and breakfast) the host grinned
        and welcomed us. It was literally the first French person
        besides the barkeep and Patou that had smiled at me all
        day. We knew we were home for the night. She showed us
        our beautiful country room and made us a deal which
        included free rental of a boat to navigate the canals
        with before dinner. I sat back and enjoyed the late
        afternoon while Andy paddled our launch through the
        canals of Venice Vert. It was so green it almost hurt my
        eyes. Even the waterways themselves verdant with the
        algae growing in them.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">When we returned her
        husband had returned and offered us a glass of his
        homemade beverage of wine and cognac. Within a few
        glasses I was woozy and ready for dinner. There our
        disingenuous server brought us a tasty meal of sliced
        duck and a terrine of fish quickly and officiously. Later
        back at &quot;the ranch&quot;, our hosts were fascinated
        by our computer so Andrew gave them a tour of our
        website. They showed us some of their digitized photos
        and gave us one of the commercial harbor and chateau
        behind it.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Within a few minutes of
        arriving in the room the pages of the book I am reading
        became blurry and I faded off to sleep awaking to the
        birds chirping and the sun beaming in the window.</font></p>

        <td><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>29 May, Arcais to
        Pouzauges, 81km</b></font><p><font size="2" face="Arial">The
        sun was shining, birds were chirping, and I felt like
        lukewarm death. Just putting on my shoes required major
        effort. Breakfast was served downstairs by Veronique, our
        terminally cheerful hostess. Afterwards, I kept my
        promise to myself to go for a walk along the picturesque
        waterways of Arcais, resisting temptation to curl up
        along the grassy banks for a nap. My walk eventually led
        me to the port, where sexy Frederic &#150;whom we had met
        last night over pineau&#151;was waiting for customers to
        push through the <i>conches</i>. He invited me across the
        street for a coffee, and showed me a handmade book of
        photos and clippings that served as the village archive.
        He told me of the frequent floods, the time he pushed
        Mitterand around in a boat with the ranking Socialists
        from nearby Niort, and the crops that are no longer grown
        in the <i>marais</i> due to the difficult labor involved
        and the lack of demand. There were many photos of cows
        being transported in the boats (&quot;that&#146;s only
        folklore now,&quot; Frederic explained) and others of an
        old guy who made eel traps out of straw, an art that died
        with him several years ago. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Both Fred and I could have
        stayed a few more days in Arcais, but we had a rendezvous
        to keep some 175 kilometers away, so shortly before noon
        we hopped on our bikes for the ride to Coulon,
        self-described capital of the Marais Poitevin. It was a
        very tough eleven kilometers against a howling wind.
        Coulon came as a disappointment after the perfection of
        Arcais; it isn&#146;t nearly as pretty a village, and has
        been all but effaced by mass tourism. We ate on a terrace
        full of Brittanic tourists and contemplated returning to
        Arcais for a lazy afternoon of napping and boating.
        Somehow, though, we managed to muster the energy to climb
        back upon our bikes and head uphill out of the swamp. On
        our first downhill of the day, I couldn&#146;t understand
        why I had to pedal so hard. A quick inspection revealed
        that I hadn&#146;t replaced my wheel properly after
        changing the rear tire this morning. It was rubbing
        against my brakes big-time, thus partially explaining my
        lethargy in the saddle for the previous thirty
        kilometers. Even with the problem fixed, however, I had a
        hard time keeping up with Fred through the steep hills of
        the intensively cultivated <i>bocage</i> of the Vendée.
        This was my first visit to the Vendee department, famous
        for resisting the French Revolution and remaining loyal
        to the crown, and to this day a bastion of French
        conservatism.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">We made our Orangina stop
        &#150;which has become a BikeBrats tradition in
        France&#151;in a little town called Vouvant. The waitress
        offered us &quot;sanguinary Orangina&quot;, made from
        blood oranges. It seemed appropriate for the
        Vendee&#146;s bloody past, so we tried it. All around us
        on the terrace it was Brit-o-rama, signaling that we were
        once again in tourist country. We made a quick visit to
        the town&#146;s ramparts, the creepy church and a tower
        that legend says was built by magic in one day.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Beyond Vouvant, the hills
        grew bigger and the wind grew stronger. Windmills began
        to appear on many of the hillsides. The last twenty km or
        so into Pouzanges offered many spectacular views of the
        surrounding countryside and some of the steepest climbs
        we&#146;ve endured since the Hill Country of Texas.
        Pouzanges itself is built upon one of the highest hills
        in the region, and it was quite a pump to get to the
        strategically perched center. I had another flat tire
        &#150;this time in front&#151;and made Fred investigate
        our lodging options for a change. He came back saying
        that the only decent place in town was full, which meant
        we&#146;d have to sleep above a bar, in terrible beds
        with penis pillows. I was ready to sleep anywhere, still
        feeling like a zombie. In fact, I hardly feel worthy to
        write about today since I didn&#146;t really experience
        it as a sentient being&#133;</font></p>

        Challones, 84km</b></font><p><font size="2" face="Arial">Today
        was my day feel like death. My bed last night so soft it
        sucked me into the center and prodded me with its springs
        all night. A walk through Pouzages&#146; center square
        yielded a Pattiserie breakfast. Afterwards Andy had three
        flats before even leaving our bar/hotel. He pumped his
        tire so furiously he sprained his arm while changing the
        second. I had to change the third one for him, and as
        though a miracle had occurred the tube of the first flat
        had repaired itself without us having to patch it?!</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Cool morning breezes and
        high clouds chilled in the morning and I shivered until I
        warmed up climbing to the next town. The road started
        very busy and I shivered even more each time a big truck
        passed too closely. The road calmed, the sun flooded the
        sky and it warmed us. We ascended the tower at San Michel
        de Mercure to see the panorama from the highest point of
        the Vendee. It was tough to mount the circular stairs
        without aid of a light, but we managed only to discover
        on our descent that the light switch was cleverly hidden
        and that we could have made the climb more safely. From
        the top we had a good view of the day&#146;s ride ahead
        of us. It looked to be leveling off which would be a
        pleasant change from the hilly and windy days before. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Remounting our bikes we
        set off for our rendez-vous in Challones. Before lunch
        and after a glorious downhill we mounted a little hill
        into a town with a ridiculous name. &quot;La Trique&quot;
        means erection in especially vulgar French. There was
        nothing so exciting about this town to warrant its name
        presently but one couldn&#146;t help imagining how it got
        it in the first place. Before long we arrived in the
        sleepy little city we&#146;d intended to lunch in. Cholet
        was not very bustling for its size. Sleepy vacant streets
        produced the feeling that we&#146;d arrived on a holiday.
        We found some difficulty locating a restaurant that
        actually wanted to serve lunch. A Brasserie wouldn&#146;t
        produce a menu, another place only had one thing and
        wouldn&#146;t serve on their terrace. Finally we happened
        upon a Tex-Mex place. We were prepared for the worst
        having experienced French interpreted Mexican cuisine
        before, but we were tempted by the idea of fajitas. At
        first they too seemed reluctant to serve, but seated us
        and gave us menus. After a few minutes our waiter, and
        owner of the festively decorated salon, approached us.
        Having heard us speaking English he returned in kind.
        Turned out to be the only enterprising person in France.
        (In fact it is constantly surprising to me that the word
        for and enterprizing individual is French &#150;
        Entrepreneur?!) In fact he was very enterprising (we
        heard about it all, youngest hotel manager in France,
        apartments in Paris, leisure lifestyle, could retire
        now&#133;.) Furthermore we heard of his personal trials,
        his recent divorce, raising his thirteen year-old child
        and on, and on. Frederick Wolfgang (Che pa quoi, meaning
        we don&#146;t know his last name) had a terrible and
        reclent failure. He came to Cholet to &quot;chill
        out&quot; and play his music and ended up starting this
        business instead of relaxing, &quot;I just couldn&#146;t
        sit still.&quot; He managed to do so in oh-so-cher
        (expensive) France on an investment of only fifty
        thousand francs. As expected, there was nothing inspired
        about the cuisine, but it filled my tummy. At the time we
        intended to ask why Cholet was there but forgot and later
        learned it was famous for handkerchiefs. If worn a
        special way they indicated whether you were a royalist or
        revolutionary.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Bloated from our oversized
        lunch, I wanted to train it to our final destination of
        the day, but the train schedule would not permit this
        luxury. Good thing too, the afternoon ride was gorgeous
        on empty and lovely roads through rolling hills. The cows
        were, as always, fascinated by our pressence. The wind
        blew us all over the road and sun baking us as we headed
        for Challones. We arrived thirty seconds before our
        scheduled meeting time at a local bar with a terrace near
        the central market. Within a few minutes we were sitting
        in the sun sipping a pastis, the first since our arrival
        in France.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Just as we were finishing
        our second sip Olivier arrived. We hugged and kissed our
        dear friend from Paris and shared a bottle of the
        Loire&#146;s sweet white wine while exchanging stories of
        the last seven months. (I hadn&#146;t realized it until
        just now as I write about him, how much Olivier had been
        a part of my day-to-day life in Santa Cruz and how I
        missed that. Though he lived more than six thousand mile
        from us our house reeked of him. The chairs, fixtures,
        sofa&#146;s, and artwork he had produced were in every
        room and served as a constant reminder. Now, living so
        much more austerely I miss those daily remembrances.)
        Filled with his nervous energy and enthusiasm I became
        energized and ready for a fun weekend resting and
        catching up. We chose Challones because it is the summer
        home of two other friends we were to meet at the bar.
        William and Claire spend half the year here and half in
        India. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">We adjourned to William
        and Claire&#146;s house for more wine, papadum and
        marvelously appetizing spread of Claire&#146;s creation.
        Eggplant, fresh coriander, loads of garlic, olive oil and
        parsley went down easily. Claire and William often spoke
        in a silly parody of Indian English, and by the end of
        the weekend we were all saying things like &quot;What
        country you are from?&quot; Another phrase that we rested
        upon often while offering drink or food to one another
        was &quot;take it&quot;. An imperative that
        William&#146;s rice seller uttered to him in Varcala when
        he picked up his week&#146;s supply.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">It was a few hours before
        we made it to our Gite to clean up for dinner. M. Fardeau
        (&quot;fardeau&quot; means burden in French) showed us
        our very homey accommodations on a quiet island between
        arms of the Loire. A huge kitchen, terrace and sitting
        room below; and two rooms upstairs all looking over her
        property, donkeys, the river and the town on the other
        side. We were the last customers served in the little
        restaurant on the other side of the bridge and the last
        out much to the polite dismay of the workers there. It
        was hard to leave after the wine and a meal in such great
        company. Especially difficult for me to get up after my
        desert which was the heaviest thing ever eaten by me in
        France. An ultimately dense cake filled with dried prunes
        and other fruit drenched in creme anglais. It was
        probably my first and last Far Breton. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The next day I cleaned our
        bikes while Andrew caught up on some much needed sleep.
        Took forever to clean my hands afterwards before we went
        to visit Olivier&#146;s sister, who lives some sixty
        kilometers down river near Nantes. She spoke English
        beautifully having spent one year in the US studying. She
        showed me photographs of her trip and spoke fondly of her
        stay as though it was yesterday. Her seventies view of
        the states had hardly changed since here visit.
        She&#146;d lost contact with her host family but hoped to
        contact them again if she ever makes it there again.
        Olive&#146;s nephews were hilarious, one ultra serious,
        Romain, and the other a goofy nerd, Benjamin. We ate
        lunch in their restaurant looking out the &quot;bay
        fenetre&quot; they were so proud of. The meal they were
        not very proud of, disclaiming that it was not their
        restaurant&#146;s. Despite their reservations I took some
        pleasure in a home cooked meal with a real family. At
        desert time Benjamin ran to the kitchen, grabbed some
        plastic packaged pudding and slurped (literally) two of
        them down loudly while we waited for our desert the only
        &quot;real&quot; course of the meal having been prepared
        in the kitchen of the restaurant. We went downstairs to
        digest our food in the ping-pong room in the basement.
        There Benjie cleaned our collective clock at his game of
        choice. Each ball spinning wildly off our paddles in some
        unintended direction as though he was playing us like an
        instrument.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">A long walk along the
        Loire capped our day with Olivier&#146;s family. Soon we
        were back in Olivier&#146;s trucklet (camionette) to
        Challones. I rode in the back with all the newspapers
        left over from his Friday deliveries in Paris. Olivier
        distributes the Israeli paper there. Though he isn&#146;t
        Jewish he wishes his patrons &quot;Shabbat Shalome&quot;
        when he makes his rounds on Fridays. The road and the
        smell of the paper started to make me nauseous and I had
        to walk back from &quot;downtown&quot; Challones to avoid
        loosing my lunch. While Andy and Olive shopped for our
        picnic dinner I had a glorious sunny and windy yoga
        session on the spacious lawn on the riverbank. A solar
        salute took on new meaning. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">That night Olive and I
        decided to hit Anger (another stop on the Geoff Benson
        World Tour, as this journey will not doubt be known as
        historically. Here Geoff attended Lycee.) for a wild
        night on the town. We didn&#146;t leave until well after
        midnight anticipating a late night in a French bout de
        nuit. We had the advice of the Sparticus Guide which
        directed us to a terrible little bar. Even finding it was
        difficult, we asked three different groups of folks for
        directions before finding it. It was really
        disappointing, about five people getting drunk at the
        tired little zinc (bar in French, so named because many
        older ones are constructed of zinc). Went to a disco, and
        when we looked inside before paying we decided to ask the
        doorman where to find a real queer bar. He directed us
        across town. We arrived at a place with great ambiance.
        For one there was a good mix of folks. Gay, straight,
        girls, boys, folks of all ages listening to good music
        and smiling &#150; &quot;is this France?&quot; We felt
        right at home, for <u>everyone</u> we&#146;d asked for
        directions was at the bar. Olivier and I camped in the
        back room of the bar where folks were sitting,
        socializing and smoking on really uncomfortable couches.
        It was quieter there than in the front room and I could
        actually understand people in this environment. Olive and
        I talked to two of the guys we&#146;d asked for
        directions from earlier for the rest of the night. I
        thought one was really cute and he was very encouraging.
        Just before the bar closed I realized that Olive was
        talking to his boyfriend, oh well. Before Olivier and I
        road back to Challones I made a date to meet them the
        next evening for coffee.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The next day was tough, I
        got home to bed just as the sun began to rise. Just
        before it did the moon poked above the horizon, a
        yellow/silver sliver in the teal pre-dawn sky. The next
        night as I was off to see my friends in Anger, Olivier,
        Claire, William, their friend, Henrietta and Andrew all
        gave me advice. I felt like a little girl going on her
        first date. I should arrive a little late, drive
        carefully, be safe, don&#146;t drink too much and on and
        on. It was very heartwarming. Olive had warned me, this
        was a group that traveled in herd. He was right, there
        were ten of them at the bar when I arrived. Took a few
        moments for me to clear the haze of the night before, but
        before long I was chatting in my best French. I went home
        to dinner to Arnaud, Pierre and Jimmy&#146;s house. Jimmy
        was named after Jimmy Carter. Our president had visited
        Anger in the year of Jimmy&#146;s birth. After a simple
        supper their friends arrived one-by-one. Including a
        repulsive one that had made endless passes at me the
        previous night before spilling a drink on me. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">We had been invited to the
        home of another of their circle for cocktails while at
        the café. We made our way there after dinner. On the way
        young Jimmy made a pass at me. There I was treated to a
        French cultural experience beyond explanation. As we
        arrived they were listening to the soundtrack of a French
        musical of astronomically bad proportion.
        Starmania&#146;s insipid lyrics and music were
        astoundingly bad. Their friend were too drunk to
        converse, but sober enough to dance and lip-synch. I
        could hardly stop myself from laughing. I drove back to
        Challones carefully and sober as everyone had recommended
        wondering how I would bike the next day after two nights
        of no sleep. </font></p>

        <td><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>2 June, Chalonnes to
        Vitré, 120km</b></font><p><font size="2" face="Arial">While
        Fred explored the fleshpots (thanks, Andrew&#133; A
        little judgy, eh?!) of Angers all weekend, I caught up on
        my sleep and enjoyed the comatose pace of life in
        Chalonnes. Olivier had been singing me the praises of
        Claire&#146;s chosen hometown for many years, and
        I&#146;m glad I finally got to experience it myself.
        While the town itself is nothing special, Claire has
        managed to assemble an interesting, tight-knit group of
        Chalonnes&#146; more marginal elements, and I genuinely
        admire her and William for figuring out what they wanted
        out of life and then sticking to their guns. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Much of the weekend was
        spent going back and forth between our rural lodgings at
        Madame Fardeau&#146;s, William and Claire&#146;s
        apartment in town, and Henrietta&#146;s house just around
        the corner, which was the stage of the weekend&#146;s
        biggest drama. Australian Henrietta is married to a
        doctor from Chalonnes, Michel, and the two of them have a
        twelve-year-old son, Alex, and a slightly younger
        daughter, Louise. The family cat is called Fifi and
        officially belongs to Louise, and on our first full day
        in Chalonnes, Fifi delivered her first litter of kittens,
        seven in all. When Olivier and I first went by to view
        the kittens, all mewing in a little box, the
        neighbor&#146;s cat &#150;and presumed father of the
        kittens&#151;came by and soon both he and Fifi were up in
        a tree, hissing at each other. It took two ladders and a
        great deal of strategy to get them down. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Henrietta came by our
        place the next day to inform us that one kitten was dead
        and another was on its way. She needed Claire&#146;s help
        to console poor Louise, she said. So we all went over to
        assist with what is perhaps the most elaborate burial
        ever given for a one-day-old kitten. I suggested we name
        it Juppé, in honor of the prime minister who had
        suffered a humiliating election defeat from France&#146;s
        leftist parties that very day. Michel, an avid weekend
        cyclist, told me what to expect from the following
        day&#146;s ride while he carefully fed the other sick
        kitten milk with a syringe. By the time we left, though,
        it had died too, and many jokes were made at the expense
        of poor sleeping Louise.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">We got a late start out of
        Challones. Everyone had come by to hear the details of
        Fred&#146;s exploits in Angers, and there was another
        bottle of champagne to be drunk. The fierce wind that had
        howled all weekend had died with the kittens, and we set
        off westwards along the island, our bikes feeling
        curiously light since Olivier was schlepping our bags for
        us. Fred said he thought it was our best day&#146;s
        riding in Europe, which surprised me. It was certainly
        our fastest. After winding through country lanes at a
        leisurely pace for the first fifty clicks or so, we
        joined a straighter road and cranked along at a steady
        thirty-plus kilometers per hour, aided by a glancing
        tailwind. Lunch was not an easy thing to find at
        four-thirty on a Monday in deepest darkest France; we had
        to settle for paté sandwiches in a café in the adorable
        medieval village of Pouancé. A little further down the
        road, a car&#146;s horn honking behind us announced the
        arrival of Olivier, who surprised us by bringing
        Fred&#146;s new friend Jimmy along. We arranged to meet
        them thirty minutes in La Guerche en Bretagne, a dozen or
        so kilometers further.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Our entry into Brittany
        was marked by a curious sign: &quot;Vous entrez dans le
        pays des roches feés&quot;, which means
        &quot;you&#146;re entering the land of the fairy
        rocks.&quot; While we didn&#146;t spot many rocks or
        fairies, La Guerche looked much different from the other
        towns and villages we&#146;d ridden through that day
        &#150; lots of old crooked houses with exposed beams and
        overhanging porticos; a place that a smurf would be proud
        to call home. We still weren&#146;t sure where we&#146;d
        be spending the night, and decided we&#146;d push on to
        the town of Vitre, influenced by a group of drunken old
        Bretons at the café table next to us. They said it was a
        beautiful town well worth the detour and they were right.
        Fred and I arrived at the appointed rendezvous in front
        of the castle/city hall and Olivier and Jimmy were
        nowhere to be found. This was a bit of a nuisance since
        it was beginning to get chilly and all of our clothes
        were in Olivier&#146;s car. We found them eventually,
        though, in front of a funky old hotel across from the
        train station, where we had a dinner that was served in a
        style from an earlier era, followed by a long walk around
        the sleepy, postcard-perfect town. </font></p>

        Malo, 105km</b></font><p><font size="2" face="Arial">The
        rewards of my decadence in Chalonnes caught up with me
        this day. When I awoke, Olivier and Jimmy were gone. IHNE
        (I had no energy). Again, Andrew&#146;s front tire was
        acting up, two flats before we began. Both of us were
        beginning to become impatient with it, and snapped at
        each other as we fixed it. Finally we were en route and
        the rolling hills of Brittany passed under our tires.
        Much of the day&#146;s ride was on very quiet roads where
        beautiful, big, black and white Holsteins were surprised
        as we passed. Unlike the ride the day before we were
        burdened with our bags and a wind that impeded our
        progress throughout our journey.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">At lunchtime we found
        ourselves in a bled called St. Aubin. Quick investigation
        found a bar/restaurant that promised a five course meal
        for 55fr. Copious amounts of really average food passed
        through our lips while ever surly servers pretended we
        weren&#146;t there.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">After lunch Andy&#146;s
        tire failed yet again. We jointly cursed his bad luck and
        swore to find a bike shop in Portsmouth to rectify the
        problem. The wind became relentless as we approached the
        coast and the terrain hillier still. Andy felt guilty for
        not being able to call Caspar and Antonia and a
        functioning phone booth continued to elude us.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">We found an afternoon
        snack in a darling burg called Dol de Bretagne. Sipping a
        soda and munching little schoolboys on a bench in the
        classically cutesy French coastal town. The village
        idiot, noting that we were foreigners, spoke to us in
        one-word sentences. Andrew interested in exhibiting his
        mastery of la Langue Francaise used every tense and
        conjugation in his responses. The befuddled fool walked
        off leaving us to enjoy our snack. (Little Schoolboys are
        our favorite French confection by the biscuit
        manufacturer Lu. They consist of a Petit Beure with a
        wafer of dark chocolate bonded on it.) Though only 28
        kilometers, the trip to St. Malo seemed endless. Each
        hill feeling steeper, each gust of wind stronger. When we
        finally reached the town we found no signs indicating
        where the port was. We intended to take the overnight
        ferry directly to Britain that night. We found that the
        overnight only runs in high season and that we had to
        rest in St. Malo for the evening much to Andrew&#146;s
        chagrin. He&#146;d been here four or five times and was
        over it. For me, I was glad to rest there for a night.
        The &quot;old&quot; city was very quaint. Not really very
        old, for it had been completely reconstructed after its
        demolition during the war. We walked the ramparts that
        encircle the center and watched the sky turn a million
        different shades of blue, pink, orange and gray over the
        picturesque port and ocean. I half hoped that the ferry
        would not run so I could go to the beach and swim in the
        natural seaside tidal pool and watch a day pass in St.
        Malo.</font></p>
