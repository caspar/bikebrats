    <tr>
        <td><font size="2" face="Arial"><strong>Wednesday, 25
        December 1996, Havana to Las Terrazas, 48 miles</strong></font><p><font size="2" face="Arial">It was Christmas morning, and the
        first time this trip that we had slept past 6:30. We woke
        up just in time to watch the sun rise over the meeting of
        smog and sea that constitutes Havana. The ambiance (and
        the food) on the 10<sup>th</sup> floor breakfast room was
        pure Eastern Bloc, but the view from the terrace was
        breathtaking and the coffee gloriously strong. On the
        ground floor I discovered a travel agent who called
        around for me. I had picked Soroa &#150;70 kilometers
        west of Havana&#151;as our place to spend the night, but
        she learned that it was closed, being used as a movie
        set. After some thought (actually I think it was the car
        rental boy at the next desk who came up with it), she
        proposed the Hotel Moka in a &quot;Zona Turistica&quot;
        called Las Terrazas. She couldn&#146;t reserve us a room
        for some inexplicable Cuban reason, yet felt certain that
        there would be space and assured me that it was a
        fantastic spot. Given the gloomy surroundings of the
        lobby where we sat, I didn&#146;t expect much.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Packing our bags in our
        room, I wondered about the sounds of schoolchildren
        across the street. Wasn&#146;t Christmas a holiday here?
        Apparently not. &quot;Every day is a working day,&quot; a
        cheerless desk clerk explained to me later, with more
        than a touch of irony. I&#146;ve learned since that
        Christmas was officially canceled as a holiday some time
        in the &#145;70&#146;s. Pretty amazing when you consider
        that this country was virtually 100% Catholic before
        Castro came to power, and that even in Islamic Indonesia,
        Christmas is an official holiday.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">So we hit the road on a
        day like any other in Cuba. Billboards wished us a happy
        1997, but there were no signs of Christmas anywhere. A
        Champs-Elysees- like boulevard led us to the Plaza de la
        Revolucion, where an enormous steel portrait of Che
        Guevara &#150;the national saint&#151;graced one
        monumental building. All the clichés of Cuba surrounded
        us: decaying colonial grandeur, jury-rigged mass transit,
        the world&#146;s most antiquated auto fleet, communist
        slogans, and bicycles <u>everywhere</u>. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">For several miles through
        town we kept apace of a funny-looking tractor pulling two
        tanks. The three drunken peasants aboard this vehicle
        kept trying to get us to stop and drink with them.
        Eventually we conciliated and let them fill one of my
        water bottles with rum &#150;which is what their tanks
        (and bellies) were filled with. It was the first of many
        such encounters with what appears to be a national trait
        of boundless generosity. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Shortly thereafter we hit
        the autopista, taking a cloverleaf ramp onto the most
        amazing road I&#146;ve ever been on. Instantly we were
        plunged into a hallucinatory experience, surrounded by
        every kind of vehicle imaginable, most of them confected
        from various bits of metal and wood and held together by
        wire. The whole aesthetic was eerily apocalyptic, but the
        pace was Caribbean sluggish. &quot;It&#146;s like
        &#145;Road Warrior&#146; on Valium,&quot; I shouted to
        Fred over the din &#150;a pretty astute first impression,
        it turns out.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The autopista is a
        misnomer, since there are very few autos on it. Instead,
        it is six lanes of harmonious chaos. A sign explains that
        the right lane is reserved for bicycles, but we found it
        full of tractors, horse carts and pedestrians as well.
        One poignant image we witnessed was a guy waving us down
        desperately to sell us his wedding ring from the roadside
        as we pedaled by. Other objects for sale included garlic,
        fruit, lettuce and livestock.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The speed limit for the
        middle lane is 40km/h, 60km/h in the fast lane, and here
        you find all the vehicles from &quot;Road Warrior.&quot;
        The motorcycles all have sidecars and are loaded down
        with people and goods. The Cubans have taken the term
        &quot;multi-purpose vehicle&quot; to its (il)logical
        conclusion: semi trucks have been converted into buses,
        and 1950&#146;s Plymouths are stuffed with sugarcane.
        Many flatbed trucks have wooden shacks constructed upon
        them, to provide shade for passengers. Nearly every
        motorized vehicle also had bicycles attached to it
        &#150;even the gas trucks. On the buses, the bikes are
        hung out the windows by their seats or handle bars. Not
        surprisingly, many vehicles of all sorts were stationary
        on the shoulder, broken down.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Under every bridge were
        entire colonies of people looking to hitch a ride, and
        many of the prospective female passengers overtly used
        their sex appeal to get picked up. The air was all but
        unbreathable, choked with black exhaust in spite of the
        wind.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">About thirty kilometers
        out of Havana, though, the lanes decreased to four (plus
        a shoulder) and the traffic volume dwindled to
        practically nothing. In the countryside, we were quick to
        discover, the bicycle is the undisputed king of the road.
        Amazingly, we were able to ride abreast for the
        hundred-odd miles of autopista, a glorious tailwind
        blowing us the whole way.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">We could have made it all
        the way to Pinar del Rio city, given our average speed of
        20 mph, but Fred wasn&#146;t feeling great, so we set our
        sights on the Hotel Moka. Along the way we stopped at all
        three roadside cafés we came across. At the first there
        were only two menu items: cookie-sized hamburgers and
        rum. We decided to push on, but before we did we were
        stopped by two Cuban cyclists totally decked out for
        sport cycling. The more talkative of the two explained
        that they worked at a hotel in Havana and were on a
        training ride. As they pedaled back towards Havana
        against the wind, we pondered over how they were able to
        acquire such decadent merchandise.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">At the second
        &quot;cafe&quot; sandwiches were available, but not to
        us. It was commie weirdness that I didn&#146;t dare
        question. But then a black guy on a bike loaded down with
        oranges came by. We still had no local currency, and
        asked him timidly how many a Yankee dollar would buy. The
        answer: thirty or forty. I realized we wouldn&#146;t go
        hungry in Cuba, and was happy to learn that one could
        easily get 20 Cuban pesos for a buck. Our dollar got us a
        dozen oranges and our first fifteen pesos (which we still
        hadn&#146;t exhausted six days later).</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The third café looked
        more elaborate, and it was. There was still the
        perplexing lack of food, but refrescos could be had
        &#150;for dolares only, thank you. So Fred and I dug into
        the salty snacks purchased in Merida and sat down to a
        couple of hours of backgammon and chatting with the auto
        tourists who passed through. Patrick and his family were
        English and living in Luxembourg, and then there were the
        French, whom we soon found to be ubiquitous in Cuba.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Had we known the proximity
        and fabulousness of the Hotel Moka, we wouldn&#146;t have
        tarried there so long. A billboard announced the
        &quot;complejo turistico&quot; after less than a
        kilometer&#146;s pedal, where we turned off the autopista
        to climb some rather big hills before being greeted by
        the incomparable Doctora Maria de la Concepcion
        Perez-Eiriz at the reception desk. &quot;Yes,&quot; she
        announced cheerfully when I asked if there was a room for
        us. Quite an elegant room, too, with marble floors and a
        big terrace. I jumped into the bath with my welcome
        cocktail, and turned on CNN to listen to doings on Wall
        Street &#150;it all seemed so surreal after the autopista
        experience. Later we hung poolside for a bit of
        backgammon and prawn brochettes, followed by yoga on the
        terrace and a tasty dinner. Altogether a perfect first
        day in this mysterious, ceaselessly surprising country.</font></p>

        <td><font size="2" face="Arial"><strong>Thursday, 26
        December 1996, Las Terrazas to Vinales, 74 miles</strong></font><p><font size="2" face="Arial">After the previous day's
        experiences, we knowingly had the kitchen make us some
        sandwiches for the road. After some deliberation with
        Doctora Maria (winner: most elaborate hairdo in Cuba), we
        decided on the autopista route to Vinales. It was longer,
        but with far fewer hills. Besides, we liked the autopista
        for its halluciatory twist on the American Interstate
        network.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Again we saw pigs being
        pulled in trailers behind motorcycles, bikes loaded down
        with sugarcane, fabulous fifties cars with bike racks
        chugging along at 30mph. And today there were bonus
        wonders: A whole series of unfinished bridges over the
        road; farmers drying their rice on the highway&#146;s
        shoulder; a farmer herding his goats in the median strip.
        At kilometer 120, another tourist stand cropped up, far
        more elaborate than the previous one. We bought Che
        Guevara tee shirts and a map of Pinar del Rio province,
        and chatted with the two young, educated commies who
        manned the shop and spoke uncannily perfect English.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Rather than going through
        Pinar del Rio town, we took a shortcut through Las Ovas.
        Instantly, the whole experience changed. We were now
        witnessing everyday rural Cuba rather than Cuba on the
        move. It was surprisingly, almost shockingly, clean. Tidy
        houses with immaculate gardens. Each house had a shaded
        terrace in front with at least two rocking chairs. We
        stopped in front of one such house to check out the
        shrine to the Virgin standing on the lawn &#150;the first
        evidence of religion we had seen in Cuba. The woman
        inside the house came out and started jabbering at us in
        nearly incomprehensible Spanish. She was old and
        obviously a card or two short of a full deck. Pulling out
        a wad of American dollars from her shirt pocket, she
        asked us if we would sell her our clothes. Considering
        the way we were dressed &#150;and what we doubtless
        smelled like&#151;we pronounced the woman mad and pedaled
        onward.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Soon the road joined up
        with the main road to Vinales, whereupon we met with two
        young Cubans who were going there too. Enrique pedaled
        alongside me the whole 17 kilometers up a seemingly
        endless (though mercifully graded) hill. His was the
        first multispeed (5 gears) bike we had seen in Cuba. He
        kept telling us we should pedal slower uphill in order to
        conserve energy.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">He took us right to the
        doorstep of Los Jazmines, a communist-style resort with a
        drop-dead view over the Vinales valley. Guzzling beer by
        the pool, we met two Brits who were also touring Cuba on
        bikes. We also met Anita, &quot;Public Relations
        Director&quot; of Los Jazmines, who seemed to fancy
        herself the activities coordinator on a cruise shop and
        epitomized the perky young communist. She first urged us
        to join her on a hike up a mogote &#150;the local name
        for the bizarre karst hills which make Vinales
        famous&#151; the following day, but later reneged when
        she learned she had to pick tobacco with the UJC (which I
        correctly guessed as standing for Union de Jovenes
        Comunistas). They were picking her up in a tractor at
        7am, she said. Needless to say, it was an activity we
        chose to skip. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Later we discovered the
        Brits to be correct in their assessment of the
        hotel&#146;s cuisine and service, both of which were
        awful &#150;very Eastern European in style and flavor.
        After drinks at the funky old bar and a round of badly
        played pool, with nearly 75 miles under our belts, we
        were ready for bed.</font></p>
