        <td><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Bangkok, Pattaya and
        Angkor, halloween 1998 (a)</b><p>&quot;Bad idea!&quot;
        everybody had pronounced when we voiced our intention to
        cycle across Cambodia. Their reactions reminded me of
        when our proposed traversal of Romania was nipped in the
        bud over a year ago, causing us to make a huge detour
        through the non-Serbian remnants of Tito&#146;s
        Yugoslavia, including the Herzegovina part of
        Bosnia-Herzegovina. The issue, of course, is safety; and
        it&#146;s probably true that we&#146;re particularly
        vulnerable to the sleazebag element (e.g. bandits,
        kidnappers, corrupt officials or religious maniacs) when
        we travel by bicycle. Still, I liked the idea of riding
        through a land as exotic, car-less and unBigMacified as I
        imagined Cambodia to be. And nearly two years of riding
        through strange lands has surely built up my confidence
        in myself, as well as the belief that people everywhere
        are basically <i>good, </i>and that the idea of harming
        us would be the furthest thing from most Cambodians&#146;
        minds. So the plan had been this: we would fly from
        Shanghai to Ho Chi Minh City (we&#146;d even procured the
        necessary visas), thereby getting another taste of
        wonderful Vietnam before heading west to Phnom Penh, only
        a couple of cycling days away. In Phnom Penh we could
        test the waters before heading across Cambodia to
        Bangkok, via the reportedly magnificent archaeological
        site of Angkor Wat. It would be an adventure &#150;which
        was exactly what my brain was craving after weeks and
        months of predictable gray Chinese cities.</p>
        <p>But when we told our plan to Randy, American manager
        of our hotel in Yuyao, a startled look crossed his pudgy
        countenance, changing his expression from jocular to
        solemn in two beats. &quot;Oh, you can&#146;t go
        there,&quot; he stated gravely, &quot;I read on the
        Internet today how two tourists were just kidnapped in
        Phnom Penh, and the rest of the country is supposed to be
        even more dangerous. With the political situation the way
        it is there right now, you probably don&#146;t even want
        to be <i>flying</i> over that country.&quot;</p>
        <p>&quot;Oh,&quot; was all I could manage in response,
        all my dreams of biking through primitive villages
        sprouting out of luminous fields of rice having just been
        dashed to bits. Fred was always a little leery of my
        intended Trans-Khmer plans, and now I knew that there
        would be no convincing him. Cambodia would have to wait
        for another trip. A week later we had booked a flight
        from Shanghai to Bangkok, and maybe, just maybe, we could
        finagle a sidetrip to Angkor from there. Someone had told
        us there was a direct flight, and that while the area
        around Angkor was rife with Khmer Rouge activity, the
        temples themselves were kept safe for tourists. </p>
        <p>And within twelve hours of landing in Bangkok, still
        disoriented by the extra-strong dose of tolerance and
        abandon after so long in the repressive PRC, and more
        than a little fuzzy from the previous night&#146;s
        excesses, we found ourselves sitting in a plush
        German-run travel agency, negotiating not a trip but a
        whole tour of Angkor. Four days including flights,
        lodging, meals, a guide and a driver in one tidy little
        package. They sure weren&#146;t giving it away either,
        but we rationalized the costs with the fact that it
        wasn&#146;t every day we went to Cambodia; and in our
        hung-over state our minds didn&#146;t consider the option
        of simply booking the flight and doing the rest
        independently.</p>
        <p>Of course in retrospect that&#146;s probably what we
        should have done. Being ferried around by a guide hardly
        constitutes BikeBrats-style travel, after all.
        Nevertheless, we were relieved to learn that ours would
        be a private tour, and not with a big group as I had
        first imagined. A guide, a car and a driver all to
        ourselves! <i>Quel luxe</i>!</p>
        <p>Since our tour didn&#146;t begin for another few days
        we decided to check out nearby Pattaya for a friend of
        mine who wants to open a nightclub there. The next day we
        loaded our still-dragging asses onto a bus full of
        pleasure-seeking Europeans and their young Thai ...um
        ...escorts. Supposedly a two-hour trip, it took easily
        twice as long, due to highway construction and Bangkok
        traffic in general.</p>
        <p>Pattaya is a beach resort developed during the Vietnam
        War as an R&amp;R stopover for weary American soldiers, a
        town built on drugs, booze and sex. I had been there once
        before many years ago and found the place utterly
        reviling, a slimy miasma of the kingdom&#146;s most
        desperate and downtrodden and the drunken Teutonic
        pedophiles to whom they cater. But all the homos we met
        in Bangkok had been raving about Pattaya and I wondered
        if it had changed. &#150;Of course it had, but for the
        worse, to my mind. At the bus station we were wedged into
        the back of a miniature pickup truck along with a dozen
        other bewildered tourists and taken on an extended tour
        of Pattaya&#146;s hideous backstreets &#150;a jumble of
        half-finished concrete structures, mud streets and
        ubiquitous power lines that makes Bali&#146;s Kuta beach
        look like a masterpiece of urban planning. </p>
        <p>We had booked a room at a gay-run hotel recommended by
        a friend in Bangkok, located in a seedy little alleyway
        with a concentration of gay establishments known as
        Boystown. Directly beneath our lodgings was a nightclub
        called BoysBoysBoys, clearly advertising the bar&#146;s
        principle commodity. The whole ambiance was a little rich
        for our blood, so we penetrated into straight Pattaya for
        dinner. After walking down a pedestrian mall past
        countless bars, rebuffing the aggressive invitations of
        whole squadrons of B-girls, we found a surprisingly good
        Italian restaurant where all the other diners were ex-pat
        Italians: all male and all arriving on little Vespas.
        What a strange place, I kept thinking: an international,
        libertine retirement community revolving around plentiful
        and reasonably-priced bonkortunities, masquerading as a
        beach resort. A post-dinner stroll revealed that
        Pattaya&#146;s ghettos don&#146;t stop at Boystown. Whole
        sections of town cater exclusively to Arabs (we walked
        past one place where men sat cross-legged on pillows
        smoking waterpipes), while others are overrun with
        Chinese. In the latter area we stopped at a
        legitimate-looking foot massage parlor, an almost
        religious experience. While a woman pummeled my feet with
        little mallets, I began to think how maybe Pattaya
        wasn&#146;t so bad after all&#133;</p>
        <p>&quot;Amazing Thailand&quot; is the Thai National
        Tourist Board&#146;s publicity slogan for 1998. My
        offering for next year would be &quot;Even You Can Get
        Laid in Thailand.&quot; The beachside promenade was
        predictably laced with whores on the make, so we sought
        refuge back in Boystown. At the first bar we entered
        literally dozens of boys in underwear were swaying limply
        to cheesy disco-music on a circular stage in the middle
        of the room, slowly revolving in a clockwise direction to
        be viewed by all the customers. It reminded both Fred and
        me of sushi restaurants where small plates of food are
        transported in front of customers by means of a conveyer
        belt. Within minutes of our arriving an obese, flamboyant
        creature in heavy makeup and semi-drag nestled beside us
        and identified herself as &quot;Mama-san&quot;, the
        manager of the establishment. She asked us the usual
        questions and tried in earnest to make us feel more
        comfortable &#150;not an easy task. &quot;It&#146;s a
        busy night tonight,&quot; Mama-san bragged,
        &quot;it&#146;s only eleven and more than forty boys have
        already been checked out. Are there any that interest
        you?&quot; When we politely demurred, our friend told us
        she hoped we&#146;d come back before moving on to the
        next table. </p>
        <p>BoysBoysBoys is apparently where everyone ends up, and
        it was hopping when we arrived. More rotating sushi was
        on offer, but there was also a friendly Western-style bar
        area where one felt less like a john, a mark, a quarry, a
        lech. And the drag show was pretty good, too. </p>
        <p>The next day we called on Tui, whom another friend in
        Bangkok had insisted we look up. Friendly, relaxed and
        decidedly sexy, Tui met his Belgian boyfriend while
        working as his driver in Bangkok. Their restaurant,
        Tui&#146;s Place, is located well to the south of Pattaya
        town on a quiet beach frequented almost exclusively by
        gays. He also rents rooms, and when we learned this, we
        decided instantly to bale on our less savory
        accommodations in the center of Pattaya&#146;s sex
        factory and decamp to Tui&#146;s. </p>
        <p>Tui proved to be the perfect host in the
        heretofore-alienating world of Pattaya. He took us out to
        fantastic restaurants, a spectacularly good drag show,
        the gym, a movie, and the piano bar where he likes to
        sing cheesy Lionel Ritchie songs.</p>
        <p>A couple of days later we were back in Bangkok
        preparing for our trip to Cambodia. We left early in the
        morning of November first, which meant that we missed out
        on much of the Halloween madness in Patpong. Fine by us,
        since neither of had costumes. Besides, every day is
        Halloween in Patpong. On our first night &#150;just off
        the plane from Shanghai-- we&#146;d seen a club habitué
        with a shaven head dressed up in an elaborate black
        feathered ensemble accessorized with a caged (live)
        tarantula dangling from a little chain. Muscle queens
        mincing about in sequined shorts and nothing else,
        fashion victims from all corners of the globe and drag
        queens of every stripe: all are everyday sights in
        amazing Bangkok.</font></p>

        <p>Package tourism, Cambodian style</p>
        </td>
        <td><font face="Arial" size="2">The flight from Bangkok
        to Siam Reap is extremely short, but it separates two
        very different worlds. I looked out the plane&#146;s
        window as we came in for our landing to see clusters of
        little reed huts among unruly ricefields and wild jungle.
        Not a speck of concrete was to be seen anywhere. No power
        lines, no cars, no signs that Cambodia had entered the 20<sup>th</sup>
        century. I couldn&#146;t help but imagine myself biking
        through such a dreamlike environment&#133;<p>Siam Reap
        airport is not much bigger than your average-sized mobile
        home. Languorous bureaucrats in frayed and faded military
        attire gave us forms to fill out and issued visas ($20
        apiece, cash only please). Outside, a handsome, broad
        faced young man was holding a sign with our names on it.
        He introduced himself as Bonat and shepherded us to a
        waiting white Toyota, driven by one Mr. Lee.
        &quot;Cambodia is a poor country&quot; was one of
        Bonat&#146;s first utterances as we rattled slowly along
        the tree-lined road that led towards town. But our first
        (and lasting) impressions of Cambodia were how
        magnificently simple and slow-moving everything seemed to
        be; it was the most gloriously undeveloped place
        we&#146;d been in since Laos many months ago. </p>
        <p>While it was still morning, the heat had already
        begun, so Bonat proposed that we rest at our nondescript
        hotel until 2:30 in the afternoon. &quot;I have a wedding
        to go to anyway,&quot; he said, adding by way of
        explanation, &quot;you see the monks have been staying in
        the temples fasting for the last month, and now they all
        come out, so everyone weddings now.&quot; This plan
        suited us just fine, as we were both in desperate need of
        a nap. Still, I immediately felt the pangs of longing for
        a more independent itinerary, regretting having fallen
        into the role of package tourists. </p>
        <p>At 2:30 the car was waiting, and as soon as Mr. Lee
        saw us he leapt out and opened the doors for us, thus
        underlining our situation&#146;s colonial aspect. We
        rolled torpidly through tiny central Siam Reap, past the
        appropriately named Grand Hotel d&#146;Angkor &#150;a
        colonial relic recently refurbished into a five-star
        property&#151;and down the long avenue leading to the
        ancient town and temples of Angkor. First stop was the
        most famous attraction in the whole kingdom: Angkor Wat.
        Built in the 12<sup>th</sup> century by King Suryavarman
        II, this huge temple ranks among the most awesome
        structures I&#146;ve ever laid eyes upon. It is huge,
        covering an area of 500 acres, surrounded by a 5
        ½-kilometer moat, and rising to 700 feet above the
        ground at its highest point. And every wall &#150;of
        which there are many&#151;is covered with carvings and
        bas-reliefs, most of them amazingly well-preserved. </p>
        <p>We spent hours there and only scratched the surface.
        Bonat pointed out the highlights and told us the stories
        behind the massive murals, most of them culled from the
        twin Hindu epics: the Ramayana and the Mahabarata. By no
        means were we the only tourists there. Since it was one
        of the biggest Cambodian holidays of the year (I forget
        its name, but it involves water and a Brahmin-Buddhist
        idea of purification) most of our fellow tourists were
        Cambodian. Many were picnicking beside the moat or
        perusing the tacky souvenir items for sale by aggressive
        locals. As we walked around the complex, we picked up a
        few &quot;gnats&quot; --little village boys who would fan
        us and point out details that Bonat had neglected. </p>
        <p>From Angkor Wat we went to a nearby hill to watch the
        sunset. The place was covered with more aggressive
        vendors selling a variety of useless items, but the views
        were fantastic. A huge carpet of jungle spread in every
        direction, with verdant hills looming in the distance. </p>
        <p>Later in the evening Bonat picked us up and deposited
        us at a funky outdoor restaurant, where we sampled Khmer
        fish dishes. We met some English aid workers living in
        nearby Battambang at the table next to us and asked them
        what they thought about the possibilities of cycling
        across Cambodia. When they stated that it would be tough
        but doable, my mind began to whir with plans for a future
        trip. </p>
        <p>After dinner we went out in search of nightlife on
        foot. Boys and men on scooters kept pulling alongside us
        asking if we wanted rides (the Siem Reap version of
        taxis), and most offered girls too. When I told one that
        we weren&#146;t interested in girls, he surprised me by
        saying without missing a beat, &quot;Oh, if you like
        boys, I can get you one of those too. Nice massage, and
        very good sex afterwards.&quot; Uptight Americans that we
        are, we graciously declined his generous offer, and moved
        on to check out the dark riverside promenade, an
        amazingly bourgeois-looking park reminiscent of
        Paris&#146; Parc Monceau and the Grand Hotel
        d&#146;Angkor which faces it. Inside the glamorous old
        palace we found tasty deserts but skipped the sanitized
        bar. We wanted something more authentic, but we
        didn&#146;t find it that night. Fatigue set in pretty
        fast as we wandered aimlessly through the abandoned night
        streets. When the umpteenth motorcycle taxis offered us
        their services we hopped on and were beneath our sheets
        by ten-thirty or so.</font></p>
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><font face="Arial" size="2">The next morning we were
        up at dawn. Our program for the day was the &quot;petit
        circuit&quot;, an itinerary developed by the French
        archeologists who renovated Angkor in the 30&#146;s.
        First stop was on of the magnificent gates to Angkor
        Thom, the old capital. At the precise center of the old
        city is a huge and highly distinctive temple known as the
        Bayon, a massive pile of rocks punctuated by 54 towers,
        each of these bearing four huge faces. Highly detailed
        bas-reliefs decorate the walls below, and here Bonat
        proved his worth as a guide, giving the background
        history of the various wars and stories depicted in the
        stone. The scenes of everyday life were the best part for
        me: monkeys in a coconut tree, wedding scenes, Chinese
        traders, women removing lice from each others hair, a
        cockfight, fishermen on Tonle Sap lake, a monk climbing a
        tree to escape a tiger &#150;all carved with spectacular
        detail. <p>Nearby we saw the Elephant Terrace --from
        which the king would view elephant fights&#151;the
        Terrace of the Leper King, and the japor (just another
        pile of rocks) remnants of the royal palace. And after
        relatively rushed visits to the beautiful temples of
        Thomanon and Ta Keo we spent the remainder of the morning
        in the magical temple of Ta Promh, Bonat&#146;s favorite.
        </p>
        <p>&quot;It is my favorite because it is engulfed by the
        roots of trees that look like giant snakes,&quot; he told
        us. Apparently the French left this particular temple
        alone so visitors could see what Angkor looked like
        before being renovated. We walked among the multiple
        courtyards of the vast temple marveling at the giant
        roots of banyan trees flowing down the stone walls,
        wedging them slowly apart. It&#146;s the kind of place
        you could spend hours lingering in &#150;if you&#146;re
        not on a guided tour, that is. </p>
        <p>But our guide proved to be more flexible than most.
        We&#146;d told him that we really wanted to do some
        cycling, and were thrilled to learn that he himself had a
        &quot;racing bike&quot; and was an avid cyclist. And yes,
        he could get other bikes too. I envisioned him leading us
        along the shaded roads of Angkor in the eerie jungle
        silence, but he apparently had other plans. Only two
        bikes were provided, however; the second involved
        following the driver&#146;s nephew on a complicated trek
        through an urban village, watching out for loose farm
        animals with every step. Bonat said he&#146;d meet up
        with us at dinnertime and suggested a trip out to the
        temples near Roulos, some twenty kilometers away.
        &quot;Just make sure you&#146;re back in town before it
        gets dark,&quot; our guide warned us, &quot;it&#146;s
        very dangerous at night in the countryside.&quot;
        We&#146;d heard the same from other people we&#146;d met
        and made a solemn promise to obey.</p>
        <p>It sounded like a great plan actually, and we hit the
        road as early as we thought prudent (the sun here being
        truly vicious). Bonat&#146;s &quot;racing bike&quot; had
        &quot;12 speeds&quot; decal&#146;ed all over it, but I
        quickly ascertained that this was exaggerated by eleven
        (I&#146;m sure a Cambodian would claim it did indeed have
        twelve speeds, depending on how fast you pedal). And
        Lee&#146;s nephew&#146;s bike was a cheap Vietnamese
        specimen, designed for miniature peasants. We decided
        we&#146;d switch off once we reached our destination,
        thereby distributing the two different kinds of butt
        torture equally. </p>
        <p>Heading east out of Siem Reap on National Highway 6
        was an awesome experience, making me wish once again that
        we&#146;d ridden all the way through this remarkable
        kingdom. The scenes of village life were unparalleled,
        and the people positively glowed with amiability. Cheap
        bicycles like ours were the primary mode of
        transportation, with slow-motion oxcarts a close second.
        I was in heaven, even though the temperature still
        hovered somewhere between unbearable and deadly. I
        noticed a couple of dark clouds on the horizon and
        wondered if they&#146;d provide relief, or maybe rain.</p>
        <p>The first drops began to fall while we were walking
        through the ruins of an interesting temple complex called
        Preah Ko, inhabited by far more grazing cattle than
        camera-toting tourists. We sought shelter under a rickety
        bamboo drinks stand, and when the drops finally subsided
        we headed further down the dirt road to a much more
        imposing temple called Bakong, built in the 9<sup>th</sup>
        century by Indravarman I. Here we were besieged by the
        usual battalion of souvenir-selling urchins; they
        followed us all the way to the top of the massive pile of
        rocks before giving us a moment&#146;s peace. Back down
        below we peeked into an active <i>wat</i> and flirted
        with the monks a little bit while waiting for the rain to
        subside again. </p>
        <p>But the rain didn&#146;t subside. Instead, it
        intensified. We realized that to make do on our promise
        to be back by nightfall we&#146;d have to bite the bullet
        and ride in a steady rain. Neither of us had a watch,
        though, and we miscalculated. Not only did we not make it
        back by nightfall, but the steady rain turned into a
        steady downpour, making the ride home cooler but far, far
        dirtier. And did I mention the road? Most of it could
        hardly qualify as such, since decades&#146; worth of
        massive potholes had merged to make one big muddy, bumpy
        mess, a swathe of brown separating the green fields of
        rice on either side. The ride back seemed twice as long,
        too, partly because I had changed to the more worthless
        of the two bikes. Even when I pedaled at full force Fred
        kept getting far ahead of me and had to stop periodically
        to wait. By the time we finally reached the outskirts of
        town &#150;with a huge sigh of relief&#151;it was pitch
        dark, all available light from the moon and stars
        obscured by clouds and falling rain. The last few
        kilometers the only way to proceed had been to follow the
        taillights of motorscooters and hope they didn&#146;t
        lead us through the deepest of the potholes. All in all,
        it was quite an adventure, and when we arrived back in
        our hotel we were positively soaking wet and covered with
        mud. </p>
        <p>Bonat showed up late, looking redder than usual and
        strangely preoccupied. Lee wasn&#146;t with him, either.
        &quot;Lee is too drunk. We both went to another party and
        drank so many beers. I also am very drunk, but Lee, he
        sleeps. So we have another driver; he&#146;s not so
        drunk.&quot; Bonat led us to a different restaurant which
        was set up for weddings and seemingly ill-prepared to
        deal with foreign guests. Ordering the food was quite an
        ordeal, due in part to the staff&#146;s indifference and
        incompetence, and further complicated by Bonat&#146;s
        drunken involvement in the matter. As we waited for our
        food he sat across the table from us, swaying back and
        forth, glassy-eyed and barely capable of speech. He left
        before the food arrived, possibly to avoid hearing the
        inevitable complaints; most of the dishes tasted like
        leftovers you&#146;d throw to pigs. When we&#146;d
        finished picking out whatever edible tidbits we could
        find among the mush, we searched around for our new
        driver with no success. This wasn&#146;t a problem since
        our hotel was only a short distance away. We ambled off
        onto the dark silence of the road for another early
        night&#146;s sleep.</font></p>

        </td>
        <td><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;I think maybe
        you&#146;re not happy with dinner last night,&quot; Bonat
        read our minds the next morning, &quot;tonight I&#146;ll
        take you guys someplace special. I promise that you will
        like it.&quot; <p>&quot;And what happened last
        night?&quot; he continued, &quot;the driver he waited for
        you but then you no longer there. You walked again back
        to hotel? I hope you&#146;re not angry with me because
        last night I was very drunk. Too many parties these
        days&#133;&quot;</p>
        <p>Mr. Lee was looking a little worse for the wear today,
        suffering, no doubt, from a brutal hangover. He drove us
        slowly along the path of the &quot;grand circuit&quot;
        past the now-familiar Angkor Wat, right through Angkor
        Thom, and then further north to yet more wondrous
        temples: the mysterious, overgrown and vast jumble of
        stones known as Preah Khan (&quot;the sacred
        sword&quot;), developed by architecture-mad king
        Jayavarman VII in the 12<sup>th</sup> century; Neak Pean,
        a small and elegant structure surrounded by five
        symmetrical and symbolic ponds; the massive and
        impeccably-restored Pre Rup, associated with funerary
        rites and famous for its huge elephant statues; and
        finally the unrestored and largely collapsed Banteay Kdei
        (&quot;citadel of cells&quot;), full of exquisitely
        carved chunks and dark passageways &#150;a haven for
        snakes and other critters. This last temple is located
        beside Srah Srang, the royal swimming pool, still full of
        water and measuring 700x300 <i>meters</i>. These Khmer
        kings really knew how to live.</p>
        <p>We had finished the temple tramping portion of our
        itinerary, and it was with sentimental regret that we
        passed Angkor Wat for the last time. It had without a
        doubt been the most magnificent archeological site
        we&#146;d visited on this whole endless trip of ours.
        More impressive than Petra in Jordan, more elaborate than
        Turkey&#146;s Ephesus; more mysterious than Tikal in
        Guatemala.</p>
        <p>But further attractions still awaited us. In the
        scorching noonday heat before lunch we stopped at a
        dilapidated old monastery marking the place of Siem
        Reap&#146;s &quot;killing fields&quot;, where Pol
        Pot&#146;s evil Khmer Rouge regime had made a systematic
        attempt to exterminate all undesirable elements
        &#150;which included the educated classes. Bonat told us
        how his own father had been killed here. He had been sent
        out to work in the jungle and the Khmer Rouge soldiers
        had asked members of a work unit how many kilos of
        coconuts they had picked. When Bonat&#146;s father made a
        fair guess of it, indicating his educated, elite status,
        they killed him on the spot. A little shrine full of
        human skulls sat in the middle of a dusty field, not far
        from a monk&#146;s dormitory supposedly housing thousands
        of unclaimed, anonymous skeletons. Bonat pointed at one
        of the skulls and said matter-of-factly, &quot;That could
        be my father&#146;s.&quot; Apparently nearly every family
        in Cambodia has been affected in some awful way by the
        excesses of Pol Pot, and one wonders how this country
        will ever put itself back together again.</p>
        <p>The afternoon&#146;s excursion was less depressing:
        the &quot;floating villages&quot; on Tonle Sap
        river-lake, a unique body of water created by the
        river&#146;s yearly reverse in flow due to high water on
        the Mekong (which it joins) in the rainy season. To get
        there we passed through a part of Siem Reap we
        hadn&#146;t seen before, a deliciously leafy neighborhood
        built along torpid backwaters. As per usual, I wished I
        was gliding through this tasty landscape on my bike
        rather than in an air-conditioned, tinted-windowed
        Toyota. At the point where the road gave out we boarded a
        boat which puttered its way past floating homes, floating
        restaurants, floating supermarkets (many of these were
        paddled from door to door), even a floating police
        station. A little further towards the open water was the
        Vietnamese village, peopled by settlers who stayed on
        after the Vietnamese regime (officially) pulled out. When
        we finally reached the huge lake itself, I put on my
        trunks and jumped in. The cool water felt divine, though
        Fred reminded me that it must be partly composed of
        sewage from the two villages upstream. On the way back
        upstream we stopped at a floating fish farm set up for
        small tourist groups. Cold drinks were available, as well
        as a pet python for photo op&#146;s. We had run out of
        film at this point, which is a shame since the dramatic
        sky and golden late afternoon light was truly magical.</p>
        <p>When we got back to our hotel, the staff was setting
        up a table in front of the door for some kind of
        ceremony. There were two bowls of rice, a coconut, sugar
        and a couple of other items. Bonat explained that at the
        point where the full moon was directly overhead (around
        midnight) the ingredients were mixed and part of it hand
        fed from one person to another while the rest was offered
        to the land. When we walked around after dinner (not as
        special as Bonat had led us to believe, but definitely an
        improvement) we noticed that nearly every table had set
        up identical tables, each lit with the flames of twin
        candles. A power failure (not a rarity here) made the
        whole scene especially picturesque. </p>
        <p>One establishment that hadn&#146;t been affected by
        the power outage was the local nightclub. We had been
        meaning to check it out since our first night here, but
        didn&#146;t get around to it until our last. Inside it
        was even darker than outside; we were seated at a table
        near the door, already inhabited by a small group of
        hookers just barely distinguishable in the gloom. The
        girls made a half-hearted attempt to pick us up before
        abandoning the idea, which we met with welcome relief.
        The whole experience was uncannily reminiscent of the
        bars we went to in Savannakhet, Laos. Uniformed waiters
        served us with a high degree of obsequiousness; b-girls
        looked at us and giggled; musicians could barely be seen
        on the dark stage, though the sounds they made were
        amplified to the point of eardrum-bursting; and everyone
        would leave the dancefloor as soon as a song ended, only
        to return immediately when the next number began. The
        place had a prosperous, nouveau riche (Cambodian style)
        feeling to it. While the clientele was composed entirely
        of locals (we two whities being the glaring exception), I
        ventured to guess that most of them had made their money
        on tourist-related enterprises. Siem Reap, due to its
        influx of foreign capital, must be a relatively rich town
        in Cambodia; we tried imagining what the rest of the
        country looked like.</p>
        <p>Waiting to board our plane at the airport the next
        morning, we met a pair of young American homos --Bob and
        Mike-- the only other Americans we&#146;d seen at all
        here. Like us they&#146;d booked a tour with the German
        travel agency, though they raved about their guide and
        considered him a friend by the end of their one-week
        tour. They too were on an extended tour of Asia, freshly
        out of India and on their way to northern Thailand. We
        tried to convince them to give Laos a try while they
        prepared a whole list of addresses for us in India. We
        got so caught up in our gossipy exchange of information
        and general homo banter that I hardly noticed Cambodia
        slip out from beneath the airplane&#146;s wheels. No
        matter, though; I knew I&#146;d be back some day. </font></p>
