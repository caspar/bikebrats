        Latvia to Parnu, 148 km</b></font><p><font size="2" face="Arial">I was ready to leave Northern Europe for
        someplace more exotic and interesting. The civilized high
        point of Europe seemed too irritatingly predictable and
        easy to ride, with its big shoulders on the roads,
        friendly locals, copious roadside services and pure
        drinking water. The &quot;adventure&quot; really must
        begin. So when we set sail to Tallinn, I let go a little
        sigh of relief. Not to say that Helsinki wasn&#146;t more
        than a little fun, with the barfing Finns whose streets
        run with vomit after 4am. The thing I haven&#146;t been
        able to figure out is how they puke and place a call on
        their cell phones simultaneously. I think that Finnish
        beer must be the cause of all the illness. The flavours
        of the local brews loom in my memory as the worst and
        flattest I&#146;ve tasted and almost cure me of my
        craving for the stuff. Sounds pretty terrible, but we did
        have fun in the 2nd Italy of northern Europe (Denmark
        being the first).</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">We arrived in the great
        seaport of Tallinn finding our resting place against a
        pier amongst tens of other great vessels. Couldn&#146;t
        help but wonder along the way there if our boat had been
        manufactured by the same outfit that built the famous
        sinking ferry. Andy, upon seeing a great oceangoing boat
        of days past in the harbor, mused about spending his
        &quot;sunset years&quot; at sea. Once we disembarked we
        found that port was an ugly maze of customs and parking.
        The sights deteriorated from there as we left the sea.
        Tallinn&#146;s port was a field of gray-black Soviet
        commercial buildings. As we approached town the
        surroundings became, if possible, even more ugly. Big old
        blocks of gray public housing framed by impersonal and
        enormous boulevards created a fog that concealed the
        beautiful spires of the old town beyond.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">We&#146;d made a
        reservation at the swankest, biggest and cheesiest hotel
        in town, the former Soviet Inturist. The Viru Hotel,
        which we immediately dubbed the &quot;virus&quot;, nearly
        shaded the charming old city with its 26 floors of fun.
        One great reason to stay there is that they let us roll
        our bikes right up to our junior suite. From our window
        you could get a glance at the old town if you craned your
        neck. The old town&#146;s charm made me forget the crap
        on the outskirts. The center&#146;s skyline with its
        spiky and domed skyline evoked days of glory passed.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Though I felt a nap was in
        order we had a great walk through the old town. It felt a
        little like Prague before they &quot;Disney'ed it.&quot;
        Still quite a few streets and buildings in shambles,
        though the overall effect was lovely with the cobbled
        center of town bathed in late afternoon sun. We stopped
        in the center square and ordered a local beer, a Saku. It
        was great after the Finnish stuff. (cold dog urine is
        better than Finnish beer, it certainly has a better
        head). Afterwards we visited the Kafkaesque high town,
        the center of government. Trying to reach the high city
        was an adventure in and of itself. We climbed to the top,
        perhaps 35 meters, only to find that the end of our
        winding trail was blocked by workman&#146;s efforts to
        recobble the streets. We had to trudge down and reascend
        the hill by another route.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Winding through the
        streets below we kept mistaking some of the great houses
        of the towns for churches because they were so enormous.
        The churches had crosses and the grotesquely big merchant
        houses had beams with hooks jutting out of their faces
        like the houses in Amsterdam. Ostensibly that hook was
        for raising goods into the attics which served as
        warehouses for the merchant families.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The town&#146;s orthodox
        church looked like, well, a big onion domed orthodox
        church filled with icons whose gleaming blinded you. It
        was just out in front of that church where we agreed to
        stop referring to local currencies by their proper names.
        We&#146;d become all too confused and called Finnish
        Marks Guilders and Swedish Crowns something else. Now,
        going forward, amongst ourselves, all currencies would be
        called Agoutis in order to simplify things. (see the
        triplogues and photo galleries for Belize, Mexico and
        Cuba for more detail, but an Agouti is a little central
        American rodent) Just after making this terminology
        agreement Andy tried to buy a candle or trinket in the
        church and asked the clerk in the souvenir shop if they
        took &quot;Finnish Agoutis.&quot; To my surprise, without
        any hesitation, they seemed to understand and snatched
        the cash and gave change.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">After our tour of town a
        nap was truly in order so we made our way back to the 26
        floor brick we called home. As our heads hit pillows we
        discovered that there was an anti-nap conspiracy afoot.
        First, across the street Phillips electronics had erected
        a portable stage. Just as my eyelids drooped hopeless
        local performers were singing the local equivalent of
        &quot;roll out the barrel&quot; and other drinking songs
        to a ready crowd below. The performance was punctuated by
        an extra cheesey announcer whose comments echoed off the
        enormous commie plaza formed by our hotel and the post
        office across the way. When I finally tuned out the music
        a scaffold appeared in front of our hotel window. I
        thought they&#146;d be performing some innocuous service
        like window cleaning, but I was quickly proven wrong.
        They began using hammers and power tools to chip away the
        gray tile on the outside of the edifice just outside of
        our casa. The noise the craftsmen made resembled what I
        imagined medieval dentistry to sound like. Andy somehow
        managed to sleep and I whiled away the hours trying to
        solve our seemingly endless technical problems.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">That night, post nap, we
        hit the town for dinner, ending up in a basement of the
        old town. At first the place seemed pretty hip, and
        provided a great venue for checking out the shoe fashions
        of the patrons on the terrace and the townies who walked
        by. That dissolved when the piano player started in on
        &quot;Feelings&quot;. Needless to say, we opted to have
        coffee elsewhere.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Elsewhere turned out to be
        a discreet gay bar in the shade created by the old city.
        The outer bar was a café so dimly lit I was hoping that
        the barman might rent night vision goggles so that I
        might be able to see the other patrons. We sipped a
        coffee and allowed our eyes to adjust to the darkness.
        Quickly we graduated to Vodka. As I was purchasing our
        first cocktail a wacky Ukrainian, Sergei, danced into the
        bar. He flashed his giggly countenance at us and insisted
        that we join him at his table for a drink. Serg showed a
        keen interest in me which I greeted circumspectly. I
        wasn&#146;t really very comfortable with his weirdness or
        the awkward nature of our conversation, which was
        dominated by his Russian ramblings. I suggested to Andy
        and to Serg that they might be a better match in an
        effort to diffuse his attentions. I left them alone and
        checked out the sad and empty disco before joining
        another table.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Daniel, a Tallinnite, plus
        another local entertained me until the bar took on a
        distinctly ex-pat turn. Paul, a boisterous healthcare
        worker, appeared on the scene. He heard
        &quot;American&quot; being spoken and invited himself to
        join us. He&#146;d escaped from his tour and his sister
        to hit the town. Within a few moments he was performing
        the standard American butt-sniff, &quot;where are you
        from?&quot;, &quot;what do you do?&quot;. Soon afterwards
        another compatriot arrived, Kirk was a spook (&quot;with
        the foreign service&quot;, he said). I found myself
        suffering from the size of the drinks and in danger of
        creating an embarrassing (a la the Finns) situation if I
        remained. I excused myself, and retired to the hotel
        before executing alcohol-inspired acts (I hope).</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The next day came too
        early. The beer and vodka of the night before rang in my
        ears at breakfast and I was having great difficulty
        envisioning making a 150K day. Watching the flags flap
        wildly in the direction of our projected travel made it a
        little easier. Soon after quaffing a few O.J.&#146;s (can
        this abbreviation still be used?) from the monumentally
        unappetizing soviet style buffet breakfast we&#146;d
        packed and were en route.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Obviously we had found the
        Eastern Bloc. The road out of town was punctuated by
        unceremonious gaps in the pavement that revealed holes
        leading to the dark center of the earth. Traffic whizzed
        by us, but for the most part, the cars were respectful
        and left us lots of room to ride. I was surprised how
        quickly the city of 500K evaporated into countryside.
        Gaps in the pine and birch forest revealed the Soviet
        legacy of respect for nature. Through a thin curtain of
        trees we saw huge scars left by open pit mining marring
        the otherwise pristine groves.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">We left the main road
        opting for a secondary road to Parnus. The map marked the
        road as paved but it deteriorated into gravel with
        alarming frequency. Every segment of the road looked
        paved, each beginning with at least 200M of pavement
        before disintegrating. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The gravel got the best of
        my front tire at one point and caused me my second flat
        since arriving in Europe. I&#146;d been reluctant to tout
        my fine luck in this area, now is a good time to
        &quot;knock-wood,&quot; and hope for continued good tire
        fortune. As I stopped to change it with Andy&#146;s help,
        my right arm was still not strong enough to disengage the
        tire from the rim, an older Estonian joined us. He rode
        up on his &quot;tractor,&quot; a rather rugged one speed
        bicycle. It took him ten minutes to figure out from where
        we came. When he finally figured it out he recited his
        English lessons form grade school counting to eight and
        saying &quot;the teacher is in the classroom&quot; two or
        three times. This, and most Estonians, seem to think that
        Canada is part of the United States (perhaps it should
        be?!) &quot;Amerika, New York, Kalifornya,
        Toronto&#133;&quot;, he said during one of his English
        diatribes. &quot;Heetler, bang, bad,&quot; babbled during
        another.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">It seemed to take forever
        to change my tire. It was a multiple warhead flat, since
        the new tire failed immediately. I was proud that I was
        able to take the tire from the rim without assistance the
        second time. We found a lunch spot in the center of a
        town not far after. A pondside grassy knoll offered us a
        place to eat our lunch and rest my still aching head.
        Dozing while townspeople stopped and stared at us like
        aliens I dreamt of our final destination. I found it hard
        to imagine making Parnu this day knowing that we had at
        least 75k more to go. I&#146;d have found it even harder
        to believe if I could have foreseen our route.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Our afternoon snack placed
        us in a village that mined chalk. The whole place was
        covered by a white dust including every item in the Pood
        (which is the local word for some sort of shop or stop
        and is interchangeable with the word Kauplus.) Outside we
        met a second dude of the same age group as our tire
        change guy. He had been in the same English class,
        learned the same words and had the same
        historical/geographical perspective as the first. Of
        Estonians we&#146;d encountered I liked this type the
        best. The kids laughed at us and the middle aged were
        simply nonplused by presence. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The road after this point
        was more gravel than road. At times the pathway was so
        loose I could hardly maintain forward motion. One
        juncture was especially confusing. Andy thought we must
        turn right on a little narrow road I though I driveway
        and I thought we must go forward. He won the debate. 200
        meters down the driveway revealed its end and a farmhouse
        where the master of the house was up to his elbows in his
        ancient Russian truck&#146;s engine. He paused, tilted
        his head and walked toward us to find out what two space
        creatures were doing on his farm. Our enlightening
        conversation was composed of the city name and a few hand
        gestures revealing the route to Parnu, none of us having
        the confidence that we could speak the other&#146;s
        language.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">We finally wandered to the
        main road and were blown towards Parnus and the Baltic.
        It was Andy&#146;s turn for tire trouble. We repaired his
        twice on the road to Parnus before arriving exhausted in
        the ex-cure town of the Soviet bloc. We decided to
        &quot;princess out&quot; and went directly to the place
        that our guidebook touted as the undisputed
        &quot;best&quot; accommodation in the city.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Our first day on the road
        in the Eastern Bloc was rich and rewarding. I was so
        tired I couldn&#146;t even bask in the achievement.
        Before dinner we had reserved the Sauna, but during
        dinner we almost fell asleep in the piles of food laid
        before us. Our energy was so depleted we couldn&#146;t
        even manage to eat dessert or have our sauna. I was
        nearly asleep when we reached our room and Andrew
        couldn&#146;t even undress himself before falling asleep.
        He was snoring like a little lion cub within a few
        minutes of turning off the light.</font></p>

        Estonia to near Ungeni, Latvia, 100km</b></font><p><font size="2" face="Arial">This morning we were plagued with
        yet more flat tires, making me wonder if they would be a
        leitmotif for the long ride to Cairo. Parnu looked
        surprisingly good in the chilly morning light. We pedaled
        our way along tree-lined boulevards past funky old wooden
        houses on the way to the seaside, where Fred decided to
        perform his daily ritual of tire pressure adjustment. His
        furious pumping caused him to break off a valve, which
        made an ominous PPSSSHHHT sound. I made a mental note to
        buy another set of tubes at the next bike shop we found,
        and looked out over the beach &#150;an obvious former
        playground for the Soviet elite&#151;as he did the change
        thang on his own this time (which seemed only fair since
        he had brought it upon himself). Of course I didn&#146;t
        expect my own tire to go flat just a couple of kilometers
        down the road. This time we were in a scruffy looking
        suburb full of ugly apartment blocks, where I pulled off
        into a bus station like substance in order to perform the
        necessary act. Most of the Estonians waiting there kept
        there distance, staring at us obliquely, but one older
        gentlemen who looked vaguely like Jack LaLane hovered
        around silently for a while before telling us that he had
        played host to a pair of Britannic cyclists last year. I
        think he would have extended similar hospitality to us
        given half the chance, but we had some miles to put
        on&#133;</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">We had a tailwind again on
        our way out of Parnu, but twelve k down the pike &#150;in
        a village with the excellent name of Uulu-- we made the
        terrible mistake of taking one of my famous shortcuts.
        While it did shave several kilometers off the route and
        was virtually free of traffic, the asphalt soon gave way
        to twenty kilometers of sand and gravel. After more than
        an hour of torture, we were thirsty and covered in dust.
        We stopped in a <i>pood</i> and guzzled a few liters of
        fizzy water before pushing on. The road from here
        followed the coastline and was mercifully blacktopped,
        which allowed us to look at the scenery for a change. The
        rolling forests of pines in the stark, chilly light
        reminded me of a set from &quot;Eugene Onegin.&quot; A
        sign in front of an isolated old house on the beach
        announced a museum. Hungry for distraction, I urged Fred
        to stop and take a gander. As we arranged our steeds in
        front of the gate, two women waiting on the sun porch
        busily prepared themselves. The owner of the house was
        the robust Dora, who explained she had inherited it from
        her shipbuilder great grandfather. Dora lived in Parnu
        most of the year, but dragged her extended family back to
        their ancestral home every summer. We met grandmothers,
        cousins, nephews and grandchildren. She showed us an
        elaborate family tree before guiding us around her home.
        At first glance it was a pretty lame excuse for a museum,
        boasting little beyond tacky knickknacks made by family
        members fancying themselves artistic. The &quot;very old
        furniture&quot; she pointed out to us was unremarkable
        and would have looked right at home back at our hotel
        room at the Virus. But a closer look revealed photo
        albums both old and new which provided us with intimate
        insights into Estonian life. We even got to see more of
        our hostess than we wanted in photos of her at a nudist
        beach during a recent visit to Norway. In what had been
        the house&#146;s stables she showed us a collection of
        dolls she had made, as well as a pair of shoes she had
        worn &quot;fifty years ago, during the German time, a
        very bad time&#133;&quot; Wandering back to the main
        house, Dora shook a branch of an apple tree to offer us
        some wormy little sour apples, and then shepherded us
        into one of several living rooms for coffee and cakes. A
        crisis was going on in the kitchen. Grandma had left
        something on the wood-burning stove again and smoke was
        filling the house. Dora flew back and forth, emerging
        from the kitchen each time with armfuls of goodies. There
        was freshly baked bread and huge dishes of polenta with
        fresh blackberries. When she brought out a gargantuan
        bowl of potatoes and a plate of meat, we told her to
        stop. We had just eaten lunch, we lied, and wanted to
        make it to Latvia by sunset. What we didn&#146;t tell her
        is that we both desperately needed to pee and didn&#146;t
        feel up to asking her to use what was sure to be pretty
        scary plumbing (or lack thereof). So we bid a rather
        hasty farewell, the untouched bowl of potatoes still
        steaming on the table. When we offered her to pay for the
        visit, she thrust postcards in our hands and said she
        would accept no more than ten agoutis &#150;just over
        fifty cents. Pedaling away towards the nearest concealed
        bush, Fred announced, &quot;I like Southern
        Estonia.&quot;</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The coastal road led to a
        border crossing that is apparently is reserved for
        locals. The smiling armed guards there instructed us to
        turn back and take a dirt road back to the Via Baltica,
        the lonely highway connecting the Baltic capitals. A sign
        indicated that it would only be a 1.5km stretch, but what
        awaited us was a road not fit for a dune buggy. I had to
        push my bike through the sand more than once, thinking it
        an appropriate farewell to Estonia and its abysmal roads.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The border was vintage
        Soviet-era, with multiple gates guarded by dour-looking
        soldiers and endless lines of cars parked and waiting to
        undergo the agonizing customs process. One disheartened
        motorist managed to maintain his sense of humor somehow,
        and asked us if we had our registration papers with us.
        Luckily, bikes were given preferential treatment
        (something I consider right and fitting); soldiers toting
        AK-47&#146;s barked at us and waved us to the front of
        the immigration lines on either side of the border. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Our first impression of
        Latvia was of the markedly superior surface of its roads.
        We zoomed on down the deserted highway (all the cars were
        still waiting at the border), looking for a place that
        would exchange our remaining Estonian agoutis. We stopped
        at the first place that appeared, a sparkling new service
        station cum motel, but the unsmiling proprietor told us
        &quot;nyet.&quot; He did take US dollars, however, which
        struck me as odd since Estonia was only a stone&#146;s
        throw away and its currency is based on the rock-solid
        Deutschmark. A rotund Dutch woman materialized out of
        nowhere and started talking to us, saying she was staying
        in a cheap and clean room above. We considered following
        her example, until we learned our only food option would
        be what we could find among the standard gas station
        fare. She had come from the other direction, so we
        quizzed her on our options down the road. Not much, she
        said. We decided to push on in any case, a bit put off by
        the creepy feeling of the place and wanting to take
        advantage of the continuing tailwind. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">We hardly had to pedal the
        next thirty kilometers, so strong was the wind at our
        backs. At one point the road mysteriously split into a
        divided highway, which we had all to ourselves, causing
        me to wish cycling could always be this good. The sun was
        already low in the sky when a huge white confection
        appeared before us: the &quot;Casa Blanca Motelli.&quot;
        Obviously of recent construction, the hulking porticoed
        edifice looked like a monument to Latvian New Money;
        inside, the lobby was cold and cavernous, reminiscent of
        nothing so much as &quot;The Shining.&quot; Even when we
        learned that a night here would set us back the sum total
        of our Latvian agoutis, plus five dollars (not including
        breakfast), it was too good to resist after a hundred
        kilometers of riding. A hip young woman with dyed black
        hair and appropriate dissolute grungewear led us back to
        our overpriced room, through a courtyard where chickens
        pecked and workers insulated pipes with styrofoam. Her
        stern-looking boss hovered in the background throughout,
        barking at her employees between shooting contemptuous
        glances at us. Fred and I theorized that this woman was a
        witch, and had put all of her employees under a spell.
        What else would compel the workmen to continue doing
        their thing until nearly midnight, like indentured
        servants? Whatever the case, we decided against dinner at
        the hotel, and ventured across the highway for a sunset
        walk on the polluted beach, followed by a chilly alfresco
        dinner of schnitzel at a truck stop. When we asked the
        funny mustached owner here if he accepted Estonian
        currency, he assured us &quot;no problem,&quot; and
        proceeded to serve us with incongruous obsequiousness.
        Before retiring to our bewitchified accomodation, we
        asked truck stop dude if he served breakfast, and if he
        accepted US currency. He responded with perhaps the only
        two words he knew in English: &quot;No problem.&quot;</font></p>

        Riga, 87 km</b></font><p><font size="2" face="Arial">The
        breakfast menu at the truck stop was not unlike dinner. I
        was still happy not to patronize the restaurant at our
        hotel. The blond witch from the evening before managed to
        give me one more &quot;how dare you spend your money
        here&quot; look before we left.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Before I knew it we were
        on the road again. I found myself still tired from our
        journey two days before. That combined with the straight
        road and forest left Andrew to comment that he felt that
        he was on a stationary bike. Still, through the coastal
        forest we caught glimpses of ocean. Some thirty
        kilometers down the pike we made the town we intended to
        lunch in. As we approached there were three bike riders
        and their cycles stopped on the roadside. The three were
        huddled around one of the bikes looking frustrated. We
        stopped and offered our assistance, which was readily
        accepted. They&#146;d just gotten off the train a few
        kilometers down the road with the intent of traveling 40k
        north to camp. The least experienced of the threesome had
        collided into Natasha, sending her into the bushes and
        scraping her lip. The other casualty was the
        inexperienced one&#146;s bike (we don&#146;t know her
        name so we&#146;ll call her Anna). Anna had the worst
        bent rim I&#146;d seen. Andy pulled out his truing tool
        and went to work while I attended to Natasha&#146;s lip.
        He gave up at one point and we sat and stared at the
        wounded bike until I came up with the idea of loosening
        all the spokes and then trying to true the wheel. Andy
        applied the idea and got the bike to the point that it
        was operable. They were happy to have had the help and
        gave us half a loaf of the best rye bread I&#146;d ever
        tasted. The dude with the two girls took the bike for a
        test drive and pronounced it &quot;excellent&quot;. They
        said they&#146;d be pressing on with their journey, but I
        suspect they rode back to the station retreating to Riga
        where they began.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">We stopped at a beach side
        parking lot and food stand for lunch and watched Latvians
        and Russians frolic in the surf while munching salmon
        sandwiches. The toilets here were hilarious. They were
        simply four holes in the floor of a room. After lunch our
        pace really picked up. The wind whipped us along the
        highway to Riga while the road became more trafficked.
        One stroke of luck was that the road was closed and
        traffic was re-routed to Riga. We remained on the highway
        which was empty except for a few highway workers sealing
        the joints of the road with tar. We got a little
        splattered with tar along the way but the dirt was well
        worth the car-free travel. The road signs gave us very
        confusing directions, but before long we were in the city
        and making our way to the center.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">I stopped in a Trek bike
        shop in order to have some help with my crank that seemed
        to be making more and more noise. It turned out that the
        peddle was the culprit, not the crank. My Ritchey
        clipless peddles had corroded and needed replacement. I
        didn&#146;t like the replacements they offered there and
        convinced the tech there to help me get the peddles in
        working order somehow. He sprayed, tightened and fiddled
        until he got them to work without squeaking, advising me
        to get new ones in Poland where they will be
        &quot;cheap&quot;. I&#146;d forgotten about Andy who was
        waiting patiently outside and was near the end of his
        rope and bladder capacity.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">We set out together to
        find a place to rest for a few days, finding a charming
        new hotel in the very center of the old town. As we
        traversed the historic center we came upon a dude with a
        crutch seeking hand-outs carrying what I thought was a
        lemur on his shoulder. Later walking about we saw him and
        his mate, a babushka with a dog, walking around muttering
        to themselves near our hotel. It turned out I&#146;d
        hallucinated the lemur, which was actually a common house
        cat. We ascended the massive tower of the church near our
        hotel in order to survey the capital of Latvia. We rode
        up in the elevator with the operator who was at least
        seventy years old and appeared to be made out of wax.
        Andy asked if the phone in the elevator was connected to
        the outside world and he replied &quot;yes&quot; and
        smiled. Later on the way down we asked him a silly
        question like &quot;is the elevator internet
        enabled?&quot; He answered &quot;yes&quot; and smiled,
        leading me to believe he only spoke the few words of
        English he recited as we mounted the tower.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The evening in Riga was a
        little frustrating. First we tried to find a vegetarian
        restaurant run by the Hari Krishnas only to find it
        closed. We then wandered looking for somewhere else to
        eat, finally returning to the tourist center to eat in a
        &quot;Mexican&quot; one. Then we went on a wild goose
        chase trying to find the Spartacus Guide&#146;s
        recommendation for a queer bar in Riga. None of the three
        seemed to exist, so, again, we retreated to the historic
        center to find a bar for a nightcap. Andy was being a
        little too picky about choosing a bar and grudgingly
        agreed to have a beer at the Irish (ugh!) Bar in the same
        building as our Hotel. It was boring and nasty so we
        retired to our hotel room for an early evening.</font></p>

        <td><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>19 August, Riga to
        Siauliai, Lithuania, 137 km</b></font><p><font size="2" face="Arial">This morning while packing up I attached an
        icon of the Blessed Virgin onto my handlebar bag, hoping
        it would protect me on the road, but it soon revealed
        itself to have quite the reverse effect. After
        negotiating our way out of the cobblestoned hell of Riga
        (actually, the city had grown on us after our more than
        two days there, but its tramways, cobbles and countless
        potholes make it impossible to ride in), we found
        ourselves on a quiet country lane. The birds and crickets
        were doing their thing, the sun was shining, and I was
        thinking how ecstatic I was to be back in the saddle.
        Then Fred turned his head to gawk at a shirtless lad
        walking along the roadside, causing his bike to swerve
        violently into mine. Before I knew it I was face-down on
        the pavement, my elbows, knees and belly scraped up. But
        worse was my left hand, which hurt like hell from the
        impact. I was afraid I wouldn&#146;t be able to ride, and
        I chose to follow the route I normally do when I hurt:
        try my best to ignore it. This wasn&#146;t easy at first,
        but after a while it became clear that it would only be a
        temporary setback. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Not long after this
        incident, we found ourselves on the main road to the
        South, an excellent four-lane affair, with little traffic
        and so wide that the shoulders had shoulders. We were
        both reminded of our autopista experience in Cuba,
        especially when we saw an old couple leading their cow
        down the median strip. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Our first scheduled stop
        was in Jelgava, a biggish town dominated by a mammoth
        palace that once belonged to the Dukes of Courland. The
        rest of the town is of recent construction and u-g-l-y.
        No one could tell us where a restaurant was &#150;the
        whole concept being obviously alien to them&#151;so we
        had to settle for yet at another lunch of bread and
        salami purchased in a little kiosk. Since it would be our
        last stop in Latvia, we tried as we always do to spend
        our remaining agoutis, especially the coinage. Adding up
        the costs of a bottle of vodka, oranges, chocolate and
        yogurt, I felt like a contestant on &quot;The Price is
        Right.&quot; The woman behind the counter found our
        antics (and no doubt our clothing-from-outer-space)
        amusing, and treated us to that rarest of things: a
        Latvian smile. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">We ate at a table outside,
        entertaining ourselves by trapping wasps in Fred&#146;s
        bottle of Fanta and watching the townspeople saunter by.
        Next to us were a table of young Latvian girls dolled up
        to within an inch of their lives. I theorized that one
        &#150;if not all&#151;of them was a Mary Kay
        representative, and wondered what makes Baltic girls such
        hopeless fashion victims. Do they feel that they have to
        look like streetwalkers in order to attract the
        (decidedly unrefined and inelegant) menfolk? In Riga Fred
        pointed to nearly every girl in the street and pronounced
        her a hooker, but I doubt the market could bear such a
        glut of working girls, convinced it&#146;s just the
        fashion in these parts. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">We still had nearly a
        hundred kilometers to our goal for the night, and I
        dreaded having to follow the main road to Sovietsk and
        Kaliningrad. But the dauntingly wide red line on the map
        turned out to be a charming country road lined by birch
        trees and apple orchards. It looked a lot more civilized
        than the endless forest we&#146;d seen up to this point,
        and the warm, sun-dappled road smacked of summer. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">It wasn&#146;t long before
        we were at the Lithuanian border, which had the same
        gates and guardhouses as the Estonian border, but felt
        much more relaxed. The Lithuanian guards barely glanced
        at our passports before waving us through. A few
        kilometers later, Fred voiced his opinion that Lithuania
        felt more prosperous than the other Baltic States, just
        when I was thinking the opposite. I found it to &#150;and
        still do&#151;to possess an old-world, pre-war kind of
        ambiance. Contributing to this impression were peasants
        toiling in the fields, pitching hay into horse carts or
        carrying milk pails on their bikes; it looked like a
        Millet painting come to life. The few vehicles that
        lumbered past were ancient tractors and trucks of Soviet
        manufacture, and every woman we saw had a babushka on her
        head. We definitely weren&#146;t in Belgium anymore.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The first town we passed
        through was called Joniskis. While Fred shopped for
        frozen treats, I looked around and taught myself
        Lithuanian. It&#146;s easy, I discovered, since all the
        words are English with &quot;-as&quot; tagged onto the
        end. Above me was a sign marking the bus stop marking the
        &quot;centras,&quot; and across the street I saw a baras,
        a bankas, a restoranas and a telefonas. Fred reappeared
        with icecreamas just in time to see a drunken boy drop
        his beer bottle and stumble away, nearly falling on his
        assas. The perpetual perfectionist vis-a-vis his tire
        pressure, Fred decided he needed to change his rear tube,
        prompting me to go into a pharmacy for aspirinas
        &#150;for real-- though I had a harder time with
        &quot;Band Aid.&quot;</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Our next destination was </font><a href="glhell.htm" target="contents"><font size="2" face="Arial">Kryziu
        Kalnis (&quot;Hill of Crosses&quot;)</font></a><font size="2" face="Arial">, mentioned in our guide book as
        one of Lithuania&#146;s prime attractions. Fred
        wasn&#146;t too keen on the idea at first, since it
        involved a bit of backtracking and didn&#146;t look like
        much from the highway. After so many miles of flat, he
        wondered if the attraction was not so much the crosses as
        the hill, which from a distance looked vaguely like an
        untended garbage heap. A closer look revealed it to be
        quite an amazing sight, though, and I found it rather
        poignant in spite of being a militant atheist. Apparently
        the place is a major pilgrimage site, and the tradition
        of planting crosses &#150;millions of them&#151;dates
        back to the 14<sup>th</sup> century. The poignant part
        &#150;and the part that draws Western tourists, no
        doubt&#151;is that the Soviets bulldozed the crosses down
        at least three times. (What P.R. firm did those people
        use, anyway?) The place looked amazing in the late
        afternoon light, and we took a bunch of pictures. Dizzy
        and weak from so much riding, I was easily persuaded by
        Fred to commit a shameless act of desecration and
        self-promotion: writing our web address on a cross
        contributed by a church group from California. In our
        defense, it was already covered in American graffiti of
        the &quot;His name be praised&quot; variety. <i>[Andrew
        wins the Mr. Yellow Journalism &#146;97 award for his
        writings this day. First, shirtless boy above is fiction,
        I was avoided children hitchhiking. Next, not keen on the
        hill of crosses, hmmm?! I did question whether our
        guidebook was just in recommending an entire day and
        night trip to this town just to see the hill of crosses.
        Lastly, Andy demanded for me to find a Sharpy so that he
        could write on the cross he stole, and I suggested
        placement of further writing.]</i></font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The road to Siauliai was
        mercifully short (thank you, Jesus!) but shockingly
        hilly. The town is perched on a high hill commanding a
        view of the surrounding plains, but apparently this
        strategic situation hasn&#146;t helped much, since
        &#150;like most Baltic towns-- it has been destroyed
        countless times. What remains is a nondescript provincial
        capital dominated by the hideous old Intourist hotel
        (where we stayed) and surrounded by crumbling concrete
        housing blocks. The fifteen-story hotel was virtually
        empty, and the Soviet-era staff had turned off all the
        lights in the cave-like lobby. Boris gruffly announced
        that he would keep our bikes in the luggage room for
        three agoutis, and Natasha explained that the t.v. in our
        room didn&#146;t work because it was new. The elevator
        was scarier than most rides at Magic Mountain, and the
        &quot;floor lady&quot; glared at us suspiciously each
        time we walked by. I meant to ask her how her town got
        its Chinese name, but it slipped my mind.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">I held Fred to his promise
        to buy me dinner as an atonement gesture for this
        morning, and he got off easy. The only place we could
        find along the attractive &#150;though
        unlit&#151;pedestrian mall was a so-called
        &quot;piceria&quot; where I had a dog-food filled calzone
        and a salad that was mostly mayonnaise. Our waitress was
        competent but had the same no-nonsense personality of
        everyone else in Lithuania, causing us to doubt the many
        reports that Lithuanians were &quot;the Italians of the
        Baltics&quot; (the meal had assured us this wasn&#146;t
        the case as far as cuisine is concerned), warm, friendly
        and emotional. To me, it still felt like Brezhnev was
        running the show, especially as I lay in my tiny
        communist bed, listening to the plumbing leak and waiting
        to be carried away by sleep.</font></p>

        <td><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>20 August, Siauliai to
        Kaunas, 150 km</b></font><p><font size="2" face="Arial">I
        felt sure that our Intourist hotel breakfast was held in
        the same room where SALT II treaties were negotiated. Red
        carpet, a mile long table, hideous light fixtures and
        surly staff set the mood. Andy&#146;s assertion that we
        were the only guests was disproved when Ivan from the KGB
        appeared and chowed his meager meal. After Ivan fled,
        Andy and I sat at the end of the oversized table for the
        next twenty minutes hoping that Sergei the waiter would
        reappear and present a second cup of coffee. We
        determined that Christ was more likely to make a second
        appearance than Serg and went upstairs to gather our
        goods and git. Much to our surprise, Serg did hit the
        light of day again, but only to gawk at us as we wheeled
        our beasts down the front steps to go.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">On the way out of town we
        were shocked to find workers putting the final touches on
        the Baltics&#146; best bike path. We fled the
        not-so-charming town of Siauliai on the smooth tree-lined
        traffic free road sharing the path with happy bike
        commuters young and old. Just a few kilometers out of
        town the road evaporated and we were soon traveling on a
        narrow highly trafficked road with a soft gravel
        shoulder. Each time a big vehicle passed, it kicked up an
        enormous cloud of smoke that was half exhaust and half
        dust. The grit, grime and smog grated on my already
        scratchy throat. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">We turned off the road
        after 20 some-odd kilometers to seek a picnic lunch.
        Finding the first marketlet we stopped and went shopping.
        Interrupting the babushka coffee hour was apparently a
        mistake; consequently we were treated to a dour welcome.
        I surmised that the managers of this store had not been
        told that the wall had fallen and they were free to carry
        any goods they wanted to. The products available were
        limited to things you really didn&#146;t want to buy
        because they were so ugly or useless. Ice cream was the
        only luxury item I could see, so I indulged. After we
        slurped down two Eskimo Pie like substances each, we left
        the town whose name sounded like
        &quot;radioactivity.&quot; Andy&#146;s shortcut out of
        town entailed traversing yet another loosely graveled
        road that soon put us back on my favorite smoggy and
        dusty route. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">We breezed through another
        town whose name sounded like &quot;carcinogen&quot;
        before turning off the main route and getting on a
        slightly smaller one. Andy lost his temper and began to
        &quot;flip-off&quot; rude drivers until I reminded him of
        my discomfort with this practice. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The hot sun and dirty air
        were wearing me down, so I convinced Andy that we should
        stop in &quot;Pour-me-ah-mai-tai&quot; (or a town with a
        like sounding name) for our afternoon meal. At one point
        I had to stop eating. I couldn&#146;t smell my salami
        sandwich over the peasant standing next to me. We were
        out of water and simply had to find something before we
        both expired. At &quot;Dora&#146;s shop-n-snarl&quot; I
        received my traditional market welcome while spending
        most of our remaining agoutis on more ice cream and
        beverages. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The road became less
        crowded as we passed &quot;Schmegma&quot; and the hills
        became more prominent features of the countryside. At our
        next (or should I say &quot;My&quot;) ice cream stop I
        got another flat and proceeded to change it in front of a
        fascinated crowd of mini-market customers. In the defense
        of Lithuanians, the proprietress of the market was
        charming, smiley and friendly. In the crowd of onlookers
        was a 60-something dude who was especially interested in
        my work. He rambled in Russian to Andy while I made my
        wheel right. The whole time Andy and I bantered back and
        forth making assumptions about what our new friend was
        saying. &quot;Yeah,&quot; Andy retorted,&quot; Fred is
        slow at changing a tire. Mhhmmm, he does spend too much
        time checking and rechecking his work.&quot;
        &quot;Yes,&quot; I said, &quot;it does get harder to pump
        at the end,&quot; as Boris patted the tire. Finally, he
        took Andy by the arm, said something incomprehensible and
        when Andy confessed to not understanding him he stormed
        off angrily.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The next kilometers were
        along a single lane road that wound through a wide
        valley. Big green trees framing bright and golden fields
        of wheat treated our eyes as we rode. Soon I forgot the
        heavily trafficked roads we traversed earlier. We
        roller-coasted over the terrain counting the peaceful
        kilometers to Kaunas. Our heavenly valley presented us
        with only one problem, its walls were the only geographic
        barrier to reaching Kaunas. In order to make it to our
        destination we had to scale 50 meters in less than 500
        meters. At the top the sweat rolling off my body washed
        away the mosquitoes before they could bite. Within a few
        moments we had wound our way into town.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Perhaps the biggest
        challenge of the day was before us: finding a hotel room.
        We&#146;d intended to spend two nights in Kaunas, but
        were hard-pressed even to find a hotel. Finally we came
        upon what was the Intourist, only to realize that the
        clerk spoke no languages in common with us. After about a
        half-hour of discussions, room viewings and weird sign
        language I found a room that was later revealed to be
        available for only one night. Our receptionist, anxious
        to be free of us, found us a room a few blocks away and
        sent us on our merry way. While waiting outside with the
        bikes Andy&#146;s attitude had turned sour. Now bitten
        from head-to-foot by flying bugs he was anxious to shower
        and change. I set him down with a beer in the lobby of
        the next place while negotiations were under way at the
        next place. I had a few sips too and felt tipsy as we
        ascended the elevators to our home for the next two
        nights.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Before I knew it we were
        walking down the charming walking street of Kaunas. We
        stopped to munch on the terrace at Astra Restoranas. All
        of the hipsters of &quot;Sauna&quot; were happily sipping
        beer on the patio in the warm evening air watching the
        big and golden nearly-full moon rise along the street.
        Only about half of them were talking on their cell-phones
        while ignoring their dinner company. While I waited
        endlessly for my dinner (there was some misunderstanding
        as to whether I was eating or not?!) a Syrian boy stared
        and smiled at me paying no attention to his female
        Lithuanian date. Though Andy pegged him as a
        &quot;big-old-hairdresser&quot; he turned out to be a
        medical student. He laughed when we asked him about
        Kaunas night life. I&#146;d gotten just a little drunk at
        dinner. Our waiter had made another little (or was it
        big?) error bringing me another half-liter of beer
        instead of a little beer. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">We encountered our first
        operable cash machine in Lithuania on our way home. I
        reveled in the successful sound of the machine spitting
        out cash and printing a receipt, and celebrated by
        stopping at another mini mart where a happy clerk sold me
        my 6<sup>th</sup> ice cream of the day. Back in the room
        I slept soundly, lulled to sleep by the bassy rhythmic
        tones of our Russian neighbor&#146;s nose snoring the
        night away.</font></p>

        Latvia to Suwalki, Poland, 120 km</b></font><p><font size="2" face="Arial">In Kaunas we had no laundry to do,
        no FTP&#146;ing, no pressing errands to run. Instead, we
        had a whole day to be tourists, which felt like a real
        luxury. We wandered up and down the two-kilometer
        pedestrian mall that puts Copenhagen&#146;s Stroget to
        shame, checked out the cathedral (Lithuania&#146;s
        largest church, and full at 10 am for mass) and castle,
        crossed the river and rode a funicular to see a panorama
        of the unremarkable, industrial town, and visited two
        museums. The first of these was the predictably dull
        Postal Museum, which we stumbled into by accident, and
        the second was the </font><a href="glhell.htm" target="contents"><font size="2" face="Arial">Devil Museum</font></a><font size="2" face="Arial">, surely the only of its kind in
        the world, and consisting of an exhaustive collection of
        devil figurines. Frankly, I had expected more
        &#150;perhaps screenings of &quot;Rosemary&#146;s
        Baby&quot;, hourly demonstrations of black masses, hexing
        opportunities. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">When dinner time rolled
        around, we headed back to the Astra Restaurant where we
        had dined the night before, figuring it served the best
        food in town. We sat on the terrace to find ourselves
        surrounded by the same patrons as the previous evening,
        most of whom were wearing the same clothes. Perhaps they
        hadn&#146;t moved in twenty-four hours. We were clearly
        in THE place in Kaunas, but I knew that one more night at
        Astra and we&#146;d really feel like Bill Murray trapped
        in &quot;Groundhogs Day.&quot; While Fred continued his
        aggressive flirtation with the Syrian boy from the night
        before (once again with girlfriend in tow) <i>[Andrew
        again taking more artistic license]</i>, I struck up a
        conversation with a Frenchman from Lille, in town to help
        set up a textile factory. He said that Lithuanian labor
        costs are one-tenth those in France, and that he comes to
        Kaunas so often that his firm has supplied him with an
        apartment. When queried whether Astra served the best
        food in town, he looked at me blankly and told me that he
        wasn&#146;t sure because he didn&#146;t go anywhere else.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">We planned on having a
        cold drink back in our hotel room, but obtaining ice was
        a serious undertaking. The front desk sent us to the
        dingy upstairs bar, which was surprisingly crowded for a
        Thursday night, but the Soviet-style barmaid barked that
        only the restaurant could supply us with ice. Of course,
        once we got the attention of a waiter, he told us we had
        to return to the bar. I dragged him along with us to
        settle the matter, which had all the makings of an
        international incident. The barmaid and waiter argued at
        length before a glass full of hard water (no, we
        didn&#146;t want ice cream, I explained for the fifth
        time) was slammed on the bar in front of me, with the
        understanding that we&#146;d bring the glass back the
        next morning at breakfast. To make it totally official,
        the waiter insisted on seeing our key and duly noted our
        room number.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">But even after all that
        work, we never did take the glass of ice back up to the
        room. The other patrons at the bar urged us to stay,
        since it was &quot;English Club,&quot; the social event
        of the week for the anglophonic expatriate community of
        Kaunus. There was the drunken Chinese American who
        complained nonstop about the state of Lithuanian
        telecommunications, the freakishly tall Croatian we had
        seen earlier at Astra who played on the Kaunus basketball
        team, an obnoxious young Lithuanian-American from
        Libertyville, Illinois, and the two Danish girls we
        talked to whose names woefully escape us for the time
        being. Like the Frenchman we had met, they worked for a
        textile manufacturer constructing a plant in Kaunus. They
        admitted with a certain amount of shame that they went to
        Astra &quot;about five times a week.&quot; As interesting
        as this insular little scene was, we opted to retire to
        our room after quaffing one beer on the rocks. After all
        (as we kept explaining to our new friends) we had to get
        up and ride today.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial"></font>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">And a nasty, long, hot and
        traffic-plagued ride it was. We spent the entire day on
        the &quot;Via Baltica,&quot; the highway connecting the
        Baltics with the non-Russian world. Originally we had
        planned a little foray into either the Belorussian city
        of Grdno or the Kaliningrad Oblost, a chunk of Russia on
        the Baltic Sea (sort of a Russian Hawaii), but obtaining
        visas for these places would be costly and
        time-consuming. So we set our course in the direction of
        Poland and Lithuania&#146;s short border with that
        country, following the only possible route. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">It was hot and we had a
        nasty headwind, but it was the traffic that got to us.
        The road was an endless stream of stinky trucks and Ladas
        driven by graduates of the Butthead School of Driving.
        More than once we were run off the road into the gravel
        shoulder by oncoming cars trying to pass. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">After sixty kilometers we
        celebrated arriving at the halfway point in one piece, in
        Marijampole. Fred called it &quot;MaryHambone&quot; and
        deemed it the ideal place to spend all of our remaining
        agoutis. I sent him to the supermarket on his own while I
        decompressed on a sidewalk with a growing number of mute
        spectators. He returned with several bottles of
        non-carbonated water (a rare commodity indeed) and
        stories of Lithuanian consumer frenzy.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Our next stop was at the
        Polish border, where trucks were lined up on the
        Lithuanian side for more than four kilometers. We
        blithely rode by them, assuming we&#146;d be waved
        through as always. We passed through the several
        Lithuanian checkpoints without incident and marveled at
        the intensity of the No Man&#146;s Land on the way to
        Poland. There were more waiting trucks and an
        intimidating high fence on either side of the road. It
        looked very much like the old highway connecting West
        Berlin with the capitalist world, only with fewer guard
        towers and killer dogs. Then, at the first Polish
        checkpoint, we were stopped by a young immigrations agent
        with a Hitler complex. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">He obviously relished
        making us wait. I found it especially aggravating that a
        petty functionary was putting us in a potentially
        dangerous situation, since the sun would be down in less
        than two hours and we had thirty kilometers to ride
        before the first Polish town. Amazingly, during the
        forty-five minutes that he tortured us, he let only a
        handful of trucks through. How did they deal with all the
        backlog, I wondered? Do all the truck and bus drivers
        simply take this idiotic manifestation of bureaucratic
        terror in stride?</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">When Hitler finally did
        deign to let us pass, we still had two more posts to get
        through, with lots more barking, phone calls and
        senseless waiting. All in all, it wasn&#146;t a very
        favorable first impression of Poland. The plus side of
        this ridiculous border operation was that the road was
        deserted &#150;not counting another four-kilometer line
        of trucks waiting to leave Poland&#151;on the other side.
        It was beautiful, too. Over the course of the day we had
        climbed considerably, and the rugged, lumpy terrain
        looked like a landscape painting by Van Gogh. The golden
        light of the fading sun made all the wheat fields and
        haystacks positively glow, and the wind had died down to
        a benign breeze. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Before long we were
        screaming down a serious hill into the concrete ugliness
        of our evening&#146;s destination: Suwalki. It reminded
        me of a provincial town in China, only with far fewer
        people. Hideous concrete housing blocks everywhere, and
        the high-speed Via Baltica for a main street. We found a
        nasty communist place to in which to spend the night
        before hitting the town. It was Friday night, after all.
        But all we could find in the way of action &#150;aside
        from a string of scuzzy bars&#151;was a pizza parlor with
        an outdoor terrace. We sat down at a table with a bunch
        of downtrodden looking German lads on their way home from
        St. Petersburg. They said they felt lucky that they only
        had to wait for an hour at the Lithuanian border, since
        it had taken seven hours to enter Russia. All five of
        them were clutching backpacks that contained what was
        left of their belongings after falling prey to theft in
        both Estonia and Latvia. Fred and I looked at each other
        and thought about all the times we had left our bikes
        unguarded or had exposed ourselves to danger.
        Unconsciously I fingered my safe travel medallion given
        to me by friends Susan and Bert, thanking my lucky stars
        that our trip through the Baltic States had gone without
        a single major hitch. Maybe we should have hedged our
        bets and made an offering at the Devil Museum&#133;</font></p>
