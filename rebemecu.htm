        Belize City to Orange Walk, we followed the deserted
        Northern Highway over flat, boring terrain. It got more
        interesting from Orange Walk to the Mexican border, where
        we turned westward along the busy highway that connects
        Chetumal to Campeche, before picking up the quieter road
        that leads north towards Cancun.</p>

        of Bacalar, we took the shortcut northwest towards Merida
        &#150;a blissfully quiet and undulating road that
        connects with a busier east-west highway after 60 miles.
        We took a bus from here all the way to Muna, though the
        route wouldn&#146;t be bad at all on a bike. From Muna we
        headed southwards over a surprisingly high ridge to Uxmal
        and then followed the hilly and gorgeous Ruta Puuc back
        to Oxkutzcab.</strong></p>

        are bike lanes everywhere in Havana, and it wasn&#146;t
        difficult finding the outrageously weird six-lane
        superhighway heading to Pinar Del Rio, 120 miles or so to
        the southwest. This road was in excellent shape and was
        constantly entertaining. From it we headed into the
        mountains and the Vinales valley through some gorgeous
        scenery. The Northern &#147;Highway&#148; that passes
        through Bahia Honda (on our way back to Havana)
        wasn&#146;t too hilly, but the surface was often in
        miserable shape. The secondary roads winding through the
        hills are steep and beautiful, and they vary enormously
        in quality. Traffic is simply not an issue in Cuba,
        making it a cyclist&#146;s paradise.</strong></p>

        traffic in and around Merida, but it thinned out as we
        approached Izamal, fifty miles to the east. From Izamal
        to Dzitas the route was varied and virtually free of
        traffic. In Dzitas we followed the signs to Chichen-Itza,
        heading south along a good road that became a hassle
        after it crossed the Merida-Cancun superhighway. The road
        eastwards from Chichen-Itza is better experienced from
        inside of a bus (we learned the hard way).</strong></p>
