        for A Total Adventure</strong></font><p><font size="2" face="Arial">Sean and Kristine Edwards won&#146;t forget
        their 1990 surfing trip to the NSW Mid North Coast. It
        left a lasting impression: a career change, a new
        lifestyle and a dangerous plunge into the world of
        adventure tourism. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Sean is coordinator of
        Australia&#146;s largest cooperative adventure group
        &quot;A Total Adventure&quot; and it all started by being
        re-directed off the Pacific Highway on their surfing trip
        because of a motor vehicle accident, This led the couple
        to the lush hinterland area of the Comboyne plateau,
        halfway between Taree and Port Macquarie. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Today, adventure
        headquarters for this couple is based at the Udder Cow
        Café, Comboyne&#146;s old bakery building where the
        rustic wood fired oven that used to turn out crusty baked
        delights now adds a warm yesteryear charm to the al
        fresco dining. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">By the time they reached
        their thirties Sean and Kristine decided to shun the
        corporate world to explore the entrepreneurial rush of
        adventure-eco tourism. &quot;We drove through the place
        (Comboyne) after we were redirected off the highway
        because of a car accident. We immediately fell in love
        with the setting.&quot; Not long after that Sean and
        Kristine discarded with their former lives at Singleton
        working in the mines in exchange for the purchase of
        Comboyne&#146;s old sawmill. With a vision of rustic
        accommodation they combined their talents - Sean as the
        builder and Kristine as the designer - to transform this
        piece of historical Comboyne architecture into a haven
        for weary travellers. Just 12 months later Sean and
        Kristine quickly added another rustic building to their
        business development plan by purchasing Comboyne&#146;s
        old bakery. They have since transformed it into a groovy
        café that&#146;s become the meeting place for those who
        are hooked on adrenaline - whether it be in the water, on
        the land or in the air. With a background in human
        resources, Sean wanted to combine his tertiary knowledge
        with tourism and the natural environment. After just two
        years establishing the accommodation and café businesses
        Sean then turned his attention to networking with other
        operators of tourism ventures on the Mid North Coast. He
        saw a consumer need for more integrated packaging of
        adventure activities rather than the scattergun approach
        that was being used. &quot;I wanted to get people
        together and network: people who were basically in the
        same line of business and who had a lot to gain by
        talking to one another rather than competing with one
        another when they were all working in the same area
        anyway.&quot;</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">After the first huge leap
        over the scepticism hurdle Sean began the talking and
        moved forward with a proposal to the regional tourism
        organisation to support a funding application to Tourism
        NSW for a brochure which would effectively package all
        adventure operators on the Mid North Coast together. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">One year from the birth of
        this concept A Total Adventure has grown from six
        operators to 34. Now the push is on to further raise the
        profile of this group in international markets. From
        skydiving to surfing on a trimaran (the latest watersport
        activity to hit Australian shores), the Total Adventure
        group pride themselves on diversity and a fantastic
        landscape in which they can offer their activities to
        participants. Already in the Adventure Group&#146;s
        development stages there have been some memorable
        experiences that have proven to stimulate great after
        dinner stories, like the time Sydney Morning Herald
        travel writer Bruce Elder was being hosted in the region
        in June 1997 for a familiarisation. The Adventure group
        offered Bruce a helicopter ride that he wouldn&#146;t
        forget. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">They delivered on their
        promise. On a flight over the Comboyne and Ellenborough
        Falls area the helicopter&#146;s engine failed and
        crashed to the ground taking out an unleaded fuel bowser
        at a Comboyne service station. The good news is that
        everyone walked away from this nerve wrecking experience.
        Despite this close call Sean is proud of his group&#146;s
        safety approach. &quot;Everyone in the group is fully
        licensed, certified and insured. That&#146;s part of the
        condition for being part of the group. With any adventure
        activity it carries with it certain risks but all our
        operators ensure that they follow every possible safety
        measure to the enth degree.&quot; </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Sean explains that the
        reason why adventure activities are so good for breaking
        down stress is because of the adrenaline that is produced
        when human beings are challenged beyond the norm.
        &quot;We call it fight or flight syndrome. Getting the
        adrenaline pumping and achieving something that
        you&#146;ve never done before is really good for the self
        esteem which tends to get knocked out of people in a
        large corporate environment.&quot;</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Using adventure to build
        character, overcome fear and establish team building has
        become the focus of corporate survival courses, which are
        also offered by the Total Adventure Group. Sean says
        it&#146;s a great way to get to know people that share an
        office together. &quot;In big corporate structures
        it&#146;s easy to work with people on a daily basis but
        not really know them very well at all. By participating
        in adventure challenges it helps work colleagues to
        communicate on a different level.&quot; Sean says the
        courses are a great way to break down stress and assist
        in showing workers how to recognise the signs of stress
        in their workmates. As for the style of the courses Sean
        doesn&#146;t pull any punches when emphasising that
        they&#146;re not part of the new age Americanised
        corporate approach. &quot;We don&#146;t go through all
        the motivational psychology and bullshit terms. We use
        Australian workplace philosophy because Australians by
        and large are team-orientated people. &quot;</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">One of the most memorable
        corporate training survival groups Sean led was a six
        hour bush walk starting up the Comboyne Plateau and down
        a series of cascading gorges. &quot;It was great because
        it was to a place that no one had been before.&quot;</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">With the Adventure Group
        now well and truly established, Sean and Kristine are not
        prepared to leave themselves any breathing space. Despite
        the hard work since they started their new life in
        Comboyne Sean and Kristine still have many plans to
        further fulfil their entrepreneurial yearnings. Their
        advice to other would be entrepreneurs - don&#146;t leave
        it too late. &quot;A lot of people opt for a major
        lifestyle change, however, most leave it until their too
        old. By making the move when you&#146;re in your thirties
        you have more energy and ambition, &quot;says Sean who is
        a firm believer in the philosophy of making it happen for
        yourself. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">As for any future moves,
        Sean and Kristine are adamant: why leave a place, which
        is aptly summed up by its advertising slogan &#150; <i>&quot;If
        you can&#146;t get to heaven Comboyne will do&quot;.</i></font></p>
