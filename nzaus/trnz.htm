        28,000 Km (prologue &#150; f)</b></font><p><font size="2" face="Arial">It was with mixed emotion that I left the
        States yesterday. Inhaling I was filled with anticipation
        and excitement knowing that I&#146;d be on the road
        again. Exhaling came as a sigh, thinking about leaving
        friends and family behind again as we set forth on the
        next leg of our journey.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Most difficult for me was
        leaving my sister and family behind. This year we had a
        tumultuous holiday season. Just as my sister was putting
        the final arrangements together for her Chanukah party
        the world turned upside down for her. Coming home from my
        niece&#146;s championship soccer game she felt ill, went
        to bed and slipped into a diabetic coma for most of the
        next month. Her doctors were extremely pessimistic about
        her chances of survival and I sank into a depression so
        deep I thought I&#146;d never find my way out. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">My sister&#146;s will to
        live, her personal strength and her supportive nurses
        prevailed. I remember one Saturday morning with her
        laying in bed attached to more tubes and wire than you
        can imagine. That day I was feeling especially
        frustrated. I leaned toward her, called her name loudly
        and she opened her eyes turned her head and focused on
        me. A week later she responded more definitively. She
        opened her eyes and I began to tell her about my day. I
        was intentionally vague about a few details and she
        arched her eyebrows as if to ask me to clarify at the
        right time her voice rendered silent by the breathing
        tubes. I gave her a clue visually and she laughed at the
        joke that I made that depended on a memory of an
        experience three years before. I knew at that moment that
        my sister was on the mend.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Passing through LA on our
        way out of town it was so satisfying to see the progress
        she&#146;d made since then. I was simultaneously thrilled
        that she is doing so well and feeling cheated that
        I&#146;d constructed this trip and would have to leave
        her before I&#146;d see her back in her house with her
        daughter. </font></p>
        <p align="center"><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>* * *</b></font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">An In and Out Burger was
        the one thing we couldn&#146;t pass up on our way to the
        airport to catch our flight. Its greasy cheesy goodness
        filled our tummies and colored our breath with its fresh
        onions. We topped off this balanced meal with See&#146;s
        candies that my mom had handed me as we left Orange
        County. When I left Andy at the curbside at LAX he was so
        overcome by his caloric intake that he left his
        sunglasses in the car. Upon my return he was overwrought
        about their loss. Budget Rent-a-Car came through, finding
        them and delivering them to the curb of our terminal. The
        happy bus driver was rewarded with a chocolatey reward.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The See&#146;s came in
        handy once again when we used them to bribe the ticket
        agent to get us good seats on the flight. Our good
        fortune there combined with Andy&#146;s famous in-flight
        cocktail put him out soundly on the flight. Andy swears
        by one vicadin, one halcyon and a glass of scotch for
        airplane-bound bliss.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">I slept soundly as well,
        non-chemically induced, my head buried under my blanket.
        I woke as usual two hours before we arrived at 3:30 AM as
        my head spun with the possibilities that our new journey
        would bring to us. We touched down before dawn our heads
        fuzzy from our long transit</font></p>

        Auckland, 36Km (f)</b></font><p><font size="2" face="Arial">We sat waiting for our bicycles for nearly
        an hour not knowing where the heck they were. Standing
        nervously by the door marked clearly &quot;Oversized
        Baggage&quot; I paced back and forth while we made
        friends with a 60ish woman who&#146;d flown from England.
        Finally they announced that the Bikes were actually at
        the other end of the claim area. Andy and I skipped
        (literally) over to them and headed for customs.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">I was a little worried
        about passing through. The customs form was complicated.
        It pandered to the Kiwis&#146; warranted paranoia over
        biological contamination. Because we had bikes, the form
        stated that we had to go to agricultural inspection. The
        female officer who directed us to the red line questioned
        us about our origins, our occupations and purposes. She
        had the nerve to ask us if we had pornographic material
        on our website. Andy asked her if she&#146;d be the type
        that would visit it if it did and fortunately she
        didn&#146;t take any offense. Luckily the agricultural
        dudes were as easy going as our porn lover friend and
        passed us through. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Within a few moments we
        were outside the terminal in the humid pre-dawn air
        putting Siegfried and Roy back together again.
        Constructing a little changing room out of the discarded
        boxes we were in lycra and on the road within an hour.
        Shockingly this ride proved false the BikeBrats truism
        &quot;The road to and from the Airport is always a
        drag&quot;. Within five minutes we were on a quite road
        through farmland, mooing at cows and pumping along
        ecstatically.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">We saw two cyclists
        advancing on us after a few km&#146;s and soon they
        caught up with us. Gary and Caroline were out for a
        training ride on fast and light racing bikes. They slowed
        and guided us into town along nearly deserted roads by
        the waterfront. They led us to a vista that gave us a
        360-degree glimpse of Auckland. The two parted company
        with us just before we mounted the summit, saying it was
        too steep for them that their gears were too high for it.
        We probably should have turned around right then, put our
        tails between our legs and headed to town for brunch. A
        few moments later we were dripping with sweat, hearts
        leaping out of our chests and our legs screaming at us
        for attempting this on our first day out.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The view was worth it. And
        the tree on top of aptly named &quot;One Tree Hill&quot;
        was certainly magnificent despite its circumcision scar.
        A few years ago an angry Maori had tried to cut it down
        and had somehow been stopped and the tree saved. A
        tourist visiting from Wellington took one look at all the
        gear we were carrying and said &quot;got your chainsaw in
        there or what?, demonstrating his quick Kiwi wit.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">We navigated our way into
        sunny, warm and humid Auckland where Andy put his
        &quot;brunch curb feelers&quot; on, quickly locating a
        hip sidewalk café where we munched and slurped our
        second breakfast. This time we were awake enough to enjoy
        it. We were disappointed to find that our hotel, the
        Albion, didn&#146;t have our rooms ready as promised and
        we were just too rank to tour the city without a little
        shower. The tourist information office was glad to help
        us find an alternative and cancel our little arrangement
        with the Albion.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;Power-tourists&quot;
        I declared us as we high-tailed it to the waterfront to
        board a harbor tour. We anticipated the pinnacle of the
        tour to be a stop at the aquarium. This one was hailed as
        not your average goldfish tank. It was a reclaimed sewage
        treatment plant that now housed live penguins and a shark
        tank you can walk through. The penguins were truly cool
        but you had to get on this silly tram to see them. The
        cars were constructed to simulate snow cats and we had to
        bear really cheesy visual and sound effects before
        actually viewing the very cool birds. Turns out that 18
        of them were shipped in from San Antonio, Texas&#146; Sea
        World. We smiled at their antics as they tobogganed
        across their icy enclosure and wowed us with their
        underwater grace. The last little scene on our snow cat
        ride was a food chain demonstration. There we saw a fake
        seal eat a fake penguin and then, in turn, be munched by
        an orca (killer whale) that looked more like a blow-up
        souvenir from the penguins&#146; origin than a sea
        mammal.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">All of this consumption
        made me hungry again so we, appropriately, decided on a
        seafood snack. Targeting a little lower on the food chain
        we opted for a plate of tasty New Zealand green-lipped
        muscles sautéed in butter and wine. We mopped up the
        juice with soft bread and shared a local beer that was
        just a little too malty for my taste. Motoring through
        the harbor back towards our hotel we mused about the
        coming days and planned our itinerary, wondering what a
        night out on the town in Auckland will show us this
        night. </font></p>

        <td><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>15 February, Auckland
        to Kaiaua, 88km (a)</b></font><p><font size="2" face="Arial">After only one full day&#146;s riding in
        this country, I am already a convert to the popularly
        held belief that New Zealand is a cyclist&#146;s
        paradise.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">This morning we thought
        we&#146;d train out to the end of the suburban line, as
        recommended in our guidebook. But a consultation of the
        train schedule and a couple of phone calls revealed that
        no trains run on Sunday. We&#146;d have to pedal our
        butts all the way out of this hilly, sprawling town. Not
        exactly cycling bliss, but it was tolerable. The drivers
        were the worst part, of course. One trait they all seemed
        to share was a tendency to pull into the shoulder in
        front of us and fling their doors open. With heightened
        awareness, we picked our way along the Great South Road,
        which winds through industrial parks, cow pastures and
        the rundown centers of suburban towns with names like
        Otahuhu and Papatoetoe. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">After about thirty
        kilometers on the misnamed Great South Road, we turned
        off towards Clevedon, where we stopped at a supermarket
        &quot;takeaway&quot; for a kind of lunch. Kiwis
        apparently like their food deep-fried beyond recognition,
        as this was all that was available. The town &#150;like
        all the others we had passed through&#151;looked straight
        out of the &#145;30&#146;s or &#145;40&#146;s. Completing
        this illusion was a string of old-time roadsters passing
        by, presumably on a rally. From here the road became
        hillier and treacherously narrow. Apart from the
        occasional tree resembling something drawn by Dr. Seuss,
        the countryside bore an astonishing resemblance to
        Northern California, full of brown hills crested with
        pine. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">In Kawakawa Bay, we rode
        along a beach filled with Maoris affecting a Hell&#146;s
        Angels look: beards, bandanas, dark glasses, beer guts
        and lots and lots of tattoos. A little further we stopped
        at a busy general store, where I observed once again the
        Kiwi custom of barefootedness. The place was full of
        people shopping, but Fred and I were the only ones
        wearing any kind of footwear. I had noticed in Auckland,
        too, a surprising number of barefoot people walking in
        the street. And at Penguinland yesterday, I saw a placard
        explaining how to board and exit the conveyor belt
        without shoes. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">A signpost informed us
        that 31 kilometers lay between our exhausted, jetlagged
        butts and our intended destination. And it pointed
        straight into a seemingly impenetrable wall of mountains.
        Wearily, we climbed back into our saddles for the long
        pump up. The scenery more than made up for what was
        easily the toughest climb of the day. The road
        &#150;suddenly bereft of cars&#151;twisted its way up a
        lush, jungle-y gorge, full of the sounds of raucous,
        unfamiliar birds and the buzzing and crackling of giant
        cicadas. Huge treelike ferns brought to mind images of
        happily munching brontosauri. A couple of ups and downs
        later brought us into more open countryside: rugged brown
        hills full of grazing sheep and dappled with groves of
        trees. Following a babbling brook and under a dramatic
        sky, it was intensely beautiful, like a dream or a
        hallucination. I felt exhausted but happy, lucky to find
        myself in such enchanting surroundings. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Eventually our road
        deposited us on the coast again, this time beside the
        Firth of Thames, across from the towering hills of the
        Coromandel Peninsula. We followed its narrow and buckled
        course in a blissful yet physically drained state all the
        way into Kaiaua. Our only choice for accommodation in
        this tiny town was behind the village bar and social
        center. After some necessary ablutions, we went inside
        and met a whole host of friendly Kiwis. The main hall of
        the place was packed with rowdy old folks drinking and
        dancing to a hilarious live band. A woman at the bar
        explained that we were witnessing a private affair for
        the local &quot;Golden Oldies Club.&quot; She said that
        their chief <i>raison d&#146;etre</i> was taking group
        trips abroad. She also told us about &quot;Handle
        Club,&quot; a weekly raffle for customers who kept their
        &quot;handles&quot; (kiwi barspeak for mugs) hung up on
        hooks on a big board behind the bar. Bill, the friendly
        red-haired proprietor of the place (the Bayview Hotel, if
        you&#146;re ever in the neighborhood), showed us photos
        of other events hosted there, like the annual hunt for
        wild pigs in the forest and a boating competition on the
        bay. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">It became increasingly
        difficult to tear ourselves away from the bar; a spirited
        argument erupted between several of the patrons as to
        which route would be the best for us to follow south.
        Just after bidding farewell to all our new friends, a
        toothless and obviously inebriated fellow chimed in that
        he wanted to buy us a round. Pleading jetlag, we beat a
        hasty retreat back to our room &#150;a narrow escape. </font></p>

        Okauia Hot Springs, 111km (f)</b></font><p><font size="2" face="Arial">As we prepared for bed last night, Andy
        began to poke fun at me for having set up my mosquito
        net. He said it looked like the little tents we had to
        put over our food at Basata in Egypt to keep the flies
        from dragging off our meals. The tables turned at
        midnight when he was scurrying around looking for his. He
        had an immense amount if difficulty setting it up. You
        would have thought it was a ten thousand-piece jigsaw
        puzzle. I finally gave in and helped him just so I could
        get back to sleep.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Speaking of sleep, it had
        been a long time since I&#146;d slept so well. Once Andy
        got settled I didn&#146;t open my eyes once. Then next
        morning we arose with the sun (praise the lord that it
        doesn&#146;t really rise until around seven). We loaded
        our (seemingly extremely) heavy bikes. Mine seems to have
        increased in weight during our break. I can only surmise
        that the recharge of essentials like sun screen, energy
        bars and the like are the culprits. Not ready to admit
        that I am not in as good shape as I was when we stopped
        riding last year. That is the logical assumption given
        how sore my thighs were and tender my taint was this
        morning.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">With quiet flat coastal
        plains nestled up against brown grassed hills on our
        right and a marshy-muddy tidal beach we began our day.
        Huge black and threatening clouds seemed to close in from
        every direction. Luckily they blocked out the punishing
        heat of the sun. We stopped to breakfast where we&#146;d
        intended to stay the night before at a massive campground
        and hot spring. Breakfast was less than inspired, a
        couple of &quot;steak&quot; pies and the local Gatorade
        equivalent filled our bellies and wet our whistles while
        we watched a septuagenarian breast stroke inch-by-inch
        across the pool.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The proprietor like every
        kiwi had a strong opinion about what route we should take
        to make Te Aroha. The big problem is that it is hard to
        obtain any kind of consensus of advice here in New
        Zealand, which makes it harder to follow advice than to
        plan our own path. Turned out to be a mistake to follow
        the camping woman&#146;s directions. It led us on icky,
        boring, flat roads against the wind and through
        construction zones.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The last stretch to Te
        Aroha was along a winding rural road without traffic,
        reminding me of how much I love to bike. Riding
        side-by-side we joked and planned our afternoon.
        We&#146;d made better time since turning with the wind
        and contemplated going beyond our intended stop. Te Aroha
        turned out to be yet another Kiwi town stuck in time.
        Looking like a fifties US mainstreet, Te Aroha provided
        many fried food lunching opportunities. We stopped at the
        tourist information office in advance of eating where
        they gave us maps for free and lots of great advice.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">We munched at Jax snack
        shop and headed towards Matamata. I wondered aloud if the
        local newspaper was called the &quot;whatsamatta&quot;.
        Riding along where the valley met the mountain range we
        roller-coastered along with the wind whipping us along.
        Making our final turn towards Matamata the terrain became
        insufferably difficult as the humidity went through the
        roof. Every few hundred meters we&#146;d dive into a
        little valley and haul our way out. About the time I
        became completely exhausted we came upon a quaint little
        campground and hotspring. I bargained for a
        backpacker&#146;s room and Andy managed to upgrade us to
        a motel room complete with a kitchen. We soaked in the
        hotspring and dined on spaghetti before collapsing.</font></p>

        <td><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>17 February, Okauia
        Hot Springs to Rotorua, 74km</b></font><p><font size="2" face="Arial">Still not entirely used to riding on the
        left-hand side of the road, I pulled out onto the wrong
        side of the road this morning as we left the campground.
        Good thing it was deserted. The morning&#146;s ride was
        tough but pretty, meandering through the foothills of the
        Kamai mountain range. I&#146;d always imagined New
        Zealand to be full of sheep, but in this region cows
        appear to be the dominant species. Many of these animals
        were mysteriously penned up in the narrow shoulders of
        the roads and would freak out when they sensed us coming
        by on our unfamiliar steeds. The deer-like Guernsey cows
        were especially skittish, stampeding at the least
        provocation. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">I would have been happy
        pumping through this idyllic car-free countryside all
        day, but it was not meant to be. After 25 kilometers or
        so we joined State Highway 3 at a narrow winding stretch,
        going straight up. The traffic was nightmarish; it was
        like being in Cyprus again. And the possum-paved road
        kept climbing and climbing. On the plus side, a sort of
        shoulder appeared as the ascent grew more gradual, and
        the moist forest closed in to provide welcome shade. Just
        as we thought we could handle climbing no more, the road
        leveled off and the forest opened up onto an
        eerie-looking volcanic plateau, littered with spiky lava
        outcroppings and mysterious mounds. What ought to have
        been a delicious swoop down the other side of the
        mountains into Rotorua was mostly destroyed by road
        construction. Bumpy, loose gravel crunched under our
        tires and choked our lungs almost all the way into town.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Our first impression of
        Rotorua was eloquently summed up by Fred as we rode into
        town: &quot;This is gross,&quot; he said somewhere
        between a used car lot, a mini golf course and a Burger
        King. It looked like the entrance into practically any
        medium-sized town in America. When we turned in towards
        the center, however, things began looking up. We rode
        past parks full of steaming geothermal activity, then
        along a surprisingly deserted lakefront into
        Rotorua&#146;s &quot;downtown&quot; &#150;essentially a
        giant parking lot with some buildings randomly thrown in
        for good measure. Lunch was in a trendoid café called
        &quot;Fat Dog,&quot; where the toilets are tastefully
        grafitti&#146;d in multi-hued chalk with snippets of
        poetry and eco-musings. When I asked the server what the
        lasagna-esque blob in the glass case was, she looked at
        me with disdain and told me it was a burrito. I ordered
        it anyway; a mistake of course.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Next item of business was
        to find a roof under which to sleep. Fred scored a deal
        at the tourist office, half price at an upscale motel on
        the shores of steaming, sulfur-smelling Lake Rotorua. We
        are easily the youngest people staying here by about 40
        years, and apparently the only ones who aren&#146;t part
        of an organized bus tour. Lots of permed old Korean
        ladies dwarfed by their omnipresent suitcases, or Helga
        and Hans from Krefeld, their eyes glazed over from too
        many days looking out the window of a bus. I feel like a
        victim of tourist hype in this shamelessly touristic
        town. It&#146;s like a Wisconsin Dells which takes itself
        too seriously. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Nevertheless, the place
        does posses a certain charm. The pervasive stink kind of
        grows on you, and most of the locals are laid-back
        Maoris. Shopping at nearby Pack &#145;n&#146; Save we ran
        into nothing but Polynesians in every aisle (we
        didn&#146;t miss a one, since supermarkets often provide
        unexpected insights into alien cultures. Consider this:
        the frozen food section here is <u>inside</u> a freezer).
        We thought we&#146;d check out the town&#146;s pub scene
        &#150;if one exists&#151;but our energy levels and aching
        legs allowed for nothing beyond doing laundry and channel
        surfing in the sulfury cocoon of our hotel.</font></p>

        (f)</b></font><p><font size="2" face="Arial">It felt good
        to be back on the road and I am finally ready to admit
        that my legs weren&#146;t quite in the shape they were
        when we started. Luckily we&#146;d planned a tourism day
        here in Rotorua. The night before we&#146;d purchased
        breakfast fixin&#146;s and slurped our way through
        breakfast in bed before venturing into daylight.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">We wandered into town
        after nine and arrived at our first tourist trap just in
        time for the really big show. The orchid garden sported a
        &quot;Water Organ&quot;, sort of a dancing waters show.
        It was kind of funny for about the first five minutes.
        Lights changed colors, fountains swayed and spurted
        rhythmically, all to the tune of our favorite classics
        like Vivaldi&#146;s Four Seasons and the William Tell
        Overture &#150; not! We were really disappointed as we
        snuck out of the theater. Had we gotten there earlier we
        could have made requests from their play list that
        included such classics as Feelings and Jail House Rock.
        The Orchid Garden itself was not even as interesting as
        the Water Organ. Very few stunning specimens were to be
        seen there.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Our next stop was to be
        the Rotorua Museum. I was a little hesitant to pay the
        entry fee when I noted that they had a Bob Marley
        exposition in one of the galleries, but we paid the toll
        and entered the frigid museum. There they detailed the
        rich heritage of the Maoris, their skepticism for western
        religion and the paradise-like environment they lived in
        around Rotorua before the big events. One advent was the
        appearance of European settlers and the second, perhaps
        more dramatic, was the explosion of the mountain above
        Rotorua. The flashes of the explosions were seen in
        Auckland some 200 kilometers away and the sound heard in
        Wellington three times that distance further. We read
        account after account of the horror by survivors and saw
        photos and other evidences of the victims. One was a
        mummified cat that was on display in a plexiglass case
        looking as though it was still uttering its last cry.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">One surprise at the museum
        is that they had the same lax standards of dress as the
        rest of New Zealand. Seems almost one person in five
        doesn&#146;t even wear shoes. There were several museum
        patrons wandering around the exhibit nearly naked. Their
        attire seemed entirely appropriate in the exhibit
        entitled &quot;taking the cure&quot;. There the Rotoruans
        chronicle the history of the healing power of the
        sulfurous steamy waters that run from the ground
        everywhere. The museum is housed in the old bathhouse for
        the community and for the exhibit they restored a few of
        the rooms and pools. Andy&#146;s favorite part of the
        exhibit was the photo of the famed electric bath. We both
        pondered how fabulous and tingly that would feel, eesh!</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The next exhibit primed us
        for lunch. &quot;About trout&quot; was a simple
        collection of fishing trophies, photos of the catch of
        the day and flies. By the time we had walked through I
        was ready for a fishy repast. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">After lunch we&#146;d
        planned to go to the Maori Village and Geothermal park.
        We started to wait for the shuttle bus, but took a taxi
        instead. Our well-traveled driver had spent four weeks in
        the States last summer. There she&#146;d seen more of it
        than I ever had, travelling in a van with seven other
        Kiwis. She also gave us some insight into the problems
        brewing at the tourist attraction we were about to visit.
        We&#146;d been tipped off that there was some issue there
        by a seventy-year-old&#146;s letter to the editor in the
        paper the day before. He&#146;d complained that he had to
        pay two entry fees to see the sights he&#146;d paid only
        once to see before. The government had refused to
        &quot;cut&quot; the Maori village in on the entry fees so
        the villagers barricaded the entry and set up their own
        tourist trap. Against our Maori driver&#146;s
        recommendation, we decided on the government-run
        Geothermal Park and Cultural Center. There we knew
        we&#146;d be treated to geysers, steaming pools, boiling
        mud puddles and a kiwi bird. Between the noise of the
        park and the smell it was truly the only place on earth
        you could be flatuant without anyone being the wiser.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">All of this tourism in one
        day, but don&#146;t stop reading yet, because that
        evening we also attended a Maori version of a luau. We
        almost baled on it because the bus that was to pick us up
        seemed to have forgotten us and when we called they had
        lost our reservation. The desk clerk at our hotel
        convinced us that it was worth seeing, so we ordered a
        beer at the bar while waiting for our ride. Shirley the
        bus driver came just as we had taken our first sip, she
        made an immediate bad impression on me when she asked
        that we pour them out before getting on her bus.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">After we made a stop at
        the office of the tour company to pay for our cultural
        experience an older Maori dude boarded the bus and began
        to brief us on the cultural protocol of the event to
        come. He selected a leader for our group, a reluctant
        dude named Ron. I listened intently waiting for the
        explanation of how and why the Maoris greet one another
        by rubbing noses. Vastly disillusioned when I learned
        that only our leader would get to try out the nose
        rubbing with the leaders of the host Maoris.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">At our arrival we were
        greeted by an angry Maori who strutted, cried and made
        faces at us. His macho display was somehow diluted by the
        fact that he was a raging queen. Once we negotiated a
        truce with our hosts they invited us into their
        meetinghouse where they sang, danced and educated us
        before taking us to the holy mess tent. There we were
        served the most vile meal that had been steamed in the
        massive Maori outdoor oven, called a <i>hangi</i>.
        Dinner&#146;s cast of characters included a brooding
        Israeli, a Brit and four trailer trash Americans. One
        named Lucky could barely speak he seemed so drunk.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">We finally made our way
        home in the bus through the rain while Shirley led us in
        a multi-national sing-along. Every imaginable bus song
        was wailed by all. Lucky tmade us sing &quot;Rocky
        Mountain High,&quot; in tribute to the recently dead John
        Denver. I longed to be finished with tourism and back on
        my bike.</font></p>

        to Taupo, 103km (a)</b></font><p><font size="2" face="Arial">Dispelling any doubts that we were on the
        tourist trail, European hitchhikers lined the road out of
        town, holding signs marked &quot;Taupo&quot; and looking
        rather pathetic in the drizzle. Yet again I found myself
        happy having a bike to move me and my stuff around. The
        morning&#146;s riding was hardly ideal, though: busy SH5
        led us up a gradual, interminable incline through
        monotonous industrial forest. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">At Waiotapu we turned onto
        a side road passing through an area rich in geothermal
        activity. We biked right up to what was the best bubbling
        mud pool either of us has seen, marveling that this
        attraction was available to us free of charge. Not so for
        the &quot;painted valley&quot; down the road a piece,
        where we rubbed shoulders once again with the ubiquitous
        bus tourists. We gave the attraction a skip, but stopped
        for a nasty lunch of meat pies. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">When Fred got back on his
        bike, he realized his rear derailleur cable was broken,
        which basically transformed his 24-speed machine into a
        3-speed Dutch cruiser suitable for a leisurely pedal
        along the canals. Luckily, the terrain ahead was
        relatively gentle. Our route plunged down into a vast
        agricultural valley framed by volcanic ridges on either
        side, with Mt. Tauhara (our goal of Taupo nestled at its
        base) looming in the distance. I kept reassuring Fred
        that we weren&#146;t too far from the town, and that
        we&#146;d most likely be able to find a new cable for him
        there. In the meantime, he strained in his pedals behind
        my wind block. Just as we had resigned ourselves to a
        plodding pace into Taupo against the wind, an apparition
        emerged out of the drizzle: a panel van full of bicycle
        parts stopped by the lonely roadside. Had breathing all
        the sulfur fumes affected our brains? </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">It turned out to be a
        group of Dutch cyclists on a package tour, eating a lunch
        prepared for them by their amazingly equipped organizers.
        In typical Dutch, no-nonsense style, a woman named Helene
        sold Fred a new cable for something like four NZ dollars
        --next to a sheep pasture, miles from the nearest town. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">As Fred and Helene fixed
        his bike, the Dutch cyclists bid us farewell one by one
        until only one remained, a guy who told us to call him
        Ray. Since he was on his own, we proposed that he ride
        along with us to Taupo &#150;a fatal error, it turns out.
        </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Ray proved to be an able
        rider, happy with our often sluggish pace (especially
        uphill), yet oddly taciturn. He rode behind us most of
        the way, never addressing a word to us. I kept forgetting
        he was there as we cruised through pastureland punctuated
        with forests of pine and steaming lakes of milky blue and
        green. Nearing Taupo, we elected to take a detour to
        check out a few tourist objects on our way into town: the
        Aratiata Rapids, the Huka Falls, and yet another
        geothermal area known evocatively as &quot;Craters of the
        Moon.&quot; </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">It was at the first of
        these attractions that disaster struck. Atop the dam that
        controls the rapids, I stopped, Ray stopped, and Fred
        didn&#146;t. At first I didn&#146;t know what had
        happened, beyond Fred and Ray hugging the road. Both of
        them were pretty badly scraped up, especially Ray, who
        appeared to be in somewhat of a state of shock. We
        flagged down the first car to come along. The driver had
        an American accent, and while he was headed in the other
        direction, he offered to give Ray a lift into town, where
        his compatriots had set up camp. For the rest of the day,
        Fred and I kept looking at each other, feeling terrible
        to have played a part in what is sure to be the low point
        of Ray&#146;s cycling holiday. By far the worst accident
        we&#146;ve been a part of this trip, the event sobered us
        up a bit to the dangers of the road, and I hope
        we&#146;ll continue with an intensified sense of
        caution&#133;</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">As if to mock the darkness
        of our mood, the sun had come out at this point, shining
        on some of the most fetching scenery we&#146;ve seen in
        this country. Everything looked green and lush, and the
        sound of the beautiful blue Waikato river filled the
        ionized air. We gave the rest of the tourist stops a skip
        in the interest of attending to Fred&#146;s wounds, yet I
        couldn&#146;t help but being beguiled by our first view
        of Lake Taupo &#150;NZ&#146;s largest&#151;and the series
        of volcanic peaks towering on its far shore. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Taupo is a charming little
        place, full of tourists yet far less commercialized than
        Rotorua. In the hot pool of our cheesy Canadian-run motel
        I chatted with a trio of Kiwi tourists (two of them Dutch
        immigrants living here for forty years) who clued me in
        on certain aspects of NZ which have remained elusive to
        me. According to the formerly Dutch gentleman from
        Gisbourne, employers are hesitant to employ Maoris not
        because they are racist but because it involves a
        commitment to the employee&#146;s entire family and
        tribe. If someone in the family (close or extended) dies,
        for example, the boss is expected to attend a funeral
        that can last up to five days. I also quizzed them on
        their opinions regarding the Prime Minister&#146;s
        proposed Code of Social Responsibility, which passes into
        law such moral notions as &quot;raising a child is the
        responsibility of its family.&quot; All three dismissed
        PM Jenny&#146;s ideas as &quot;nonsense.&quot;</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">At dinner we ran into our
        mysterious American from this afternoon, the guy who
        drove Ray into town. A fit-looking and self-possessed man
        in his forties, he introduced himself as Robin and
        offered to share with us the bottle of wine he&#146;d
        brought with him. He told us of his solo travels around
        NZ by car and boat as well as his forays into the worlds
        of wine and Steadycam operation. He left quite an
        impression on both of us, a sort of traveling Buddha,
        completely free of stress or negativity. In retrospect, I
        should have asked him about my most pressing worry as we
        prepare to turn in tonight: what can we do to improve our
        karma that was so suddenly messed up on the dam today?</font></p>
