        to Pafos, 70km (a)</b></font><p><font size="2" face="Arial">The sun was shining through our porthole and
        the sea was calm; it was as if we had entered a new
        galaxy. In a way, I suppose we had; during the night, we
        had rocked and rolled our way into the easternmost
        Mediterranean, cradle of the monotheistic religions and
        &#150;perhaps because of this fact&#151;one of the most
        politically messed-up areas on the face of the planet.
        Climbing out of my coffin-like upper bunk, I felt a
        little twinge of uncertainty creep up my spine. In just a
        few hours, we&#146;d be in Cyprus, a place I&#146;ve
        always associated with car bombs, snipers, militarism and
        ethnic mayhem.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">We didn&#146;t arrive in
        port until past two, some three hours behind schedule due
        to last night&#146;s weather. Eric and Anne, a British
        couple we had met at dinner, pointed out the
        island&#146;s main geographical features as we cruised by
        them. They had been here before and gave us sound advice,
        though all I could think about were the hills we would be
        climbing, since the whole of the island looked pretty
        mountainous to me. John was on deck, too, as were a
        seemingly growing band of hippies of indeterminate
        origin, who provided entertainment with a frenzy of
        singing, dancing and yogic chanting. When we were
        actually able to hear each other over all the noise, we
        learned that John &#150;plump, balding and definitely
        eccentric-- was an air traffic controller in Fairbanks,
        Alaska. He planned to spend only two days in Cyprus,
        which he figured was enough time to check out the Green
        Line. He also provided us with some rather hair-raising
        tales of airplanes nearly crashing into each other.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Even though the seas were
        calm today, the disembarkation process was just as
        chaotic as it had been in Rhodes. The disorganized crew
        screamed out conflicting commands, the immigration
        officer on the gangplank appeared to have little grasp of
        his duties, and every car and truck wanted to be the
        first off the boat. No doubt about it: we had left the
        civilized world far behind us.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The first real sign that
        we were in a new place, though, was that the traffic was
        driving on the left. Neither of us was aware of this
        detail at first, and we nearly headed straight into a
        line of honking cars when we turned out of the entrance
        to the port. The center of town was several nerve-racking
        kilometers away. In a matter of minutes Cypriot drivers
        had earned the BikeBrats title for Worst Drivers in the
        World. More than once I had to brake hard in order to
        avoid colliding with a car turning left in front of me.
        It was if we were completely invisible to them.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The search for a place to
        stay entailed more than the usual hassle, too. While
        plenty of hotels lined the seaside promenade in the
        center of town, none of them seemed to want to deal with
        our bikes. &quot;Outside&quot; was the universal response
        as to where we could leave them, even in divey places
        with balconies large enough to accommodate a tank.
        Finally we resigned ourselves to this fact and checked
        into a place that gave us a good deal on a two-room suite
        which featured plenty of yoga room and a telephone that
        Fred thought would be easy to hook up to. We hadn&#146;t
        been able to collect our e-mail in over two weeks, and it
        came as a happy surprise when we heard the modem connect
        for a change. This fact caused us to reserve judgment on
        Cyprus, tempted as we were to write off the whole place
        as a barbaric hellhole. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">After a nap, a mediocre
        meal and a highly beneficial yoga session, we readied
        ourselves to hit the town. The first queer bar we found
        was right near our hotel, and it seemed very happening
        for being in a country where homosexuality was until very
        recently treated as a crime. Even the &quot;intent to
        commit a homosexual act&quot; (e.g. propositioning
        someone) was a prisonable offense, carrying a sentence of
        three to five years. The place was enormous, with high
        ceilings and as tasteful a decor as one is likely to find
        on Cyprus, and filled with a boisterous, mixed crowd.
        Recognizing us as outsiders, Stellios, the friendly
        owner, latched on to us immediately. He told us how he
        had lived in Paris in the &#145;60&#146;s and had also
        spent lots of time in California. Fred and I wondered if
        he was related to Siegfried and Roy, since he seemed to
        ascribe to the same aesthetic. His compact body was
        encased in a little black ensemble, opened in front to
        reveal a large number of gold chains, and his enormous
        head was topped with a lacquered helmet of something
        resembling hair, framing an alarming face apparently
        constructed of overly stretched leather. And the snifter
        of cognac in his hand seemed fused on, part of his
        anatomy. I wondered if I&#146;d ever be able to transform
        myself into such an extraordinary creature in my dotage,
        or if I&#146;ll follow the more standard route of running
        a dusty antique or book shop full of cats, lounging
        around in a mumu and listening to recordings of Maria
        Callas. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Our host informed us that
        the drag show was about to begin, warning us not to
        expect much. I thought he was just being modest, but the
        spectacle which ensued was truly the worst I&#146;ve ever
        witnessed &#150;the kind of show where they ought to hand
        out shovels beforehand to allow you to dig yourself a
        hole to hide in. One performer in particular had
        perfected a sort of Brechtian drag routine, wherein
        he&#146;d lip-synch maudlin Greek ballads while
        staggering around stage clutching a bottle of booze, his
        wig askew, his dress three sizes too small, and his
        gonads untucked. Another performer was a pioneer in the
        extremely dubious art of drag-striptease. Much more
        genuine entertainment was supplied by a boy sitting at
        the table in front of us, who told Fred in no uncertain
        terms not to look at him. Unable to restrain myself, I
        yelled into his ear, &quot;Exactly what kind of loser are
        you, anyway?&quot; Thankfully, he didn&#146;t understand
        me; nor did he press any charges against Fred, who
        probably wouldn&#146;t enjoy Cypriot jail. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Once the show was over
        (its only merit was its brevity), Fred got himself into
        yet another argument with a malodorous young chap called
        Nikos, who voiced disdain for the Turks and all things
        Turkish, while I hobnobbed with Nicolai the Russian, who
        had recently left a teaching career to pursue investment
        banking. (<i>Ironically Nikos claimed that all Turks were
        dirty - F</i>)</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Very rarely do we stay out
        late on the eve of a riding day, but we knew that today
        would be a short one, at least in terms of mileage. Pafos
        is only 70 kilometers from Limassol on the map, yet it
        felt a lot longer.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">We set out just after
        lunch &#150;a feta-free xoriatiki plus a lame excuse for
        a pizza&#151;retracing our hazardous route to the port,
        and then beyond the city limits through a wonderfully
        level area of orchards and vineyards. The flat terrain
        didn&#146;t last long, however. At the unremarkable
        archeological site of Kourion, the road made a sharp turn
        skywards. In a matter of minutes we were glistening with
        sweat and pumping along a high cliff with fantastic views
        of the azure sea below. Then our route plunged and dipped
        and climbed again through a very extensive British
        military base before dumping us abruptly onto the hell of
        the main highway, and the only road to Pafos.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">It was one of those
        moments of existential crisis. We were climbing up the
        most brutal hill of the day, on a ridiculously narrow
        road, and the traffic was nothing short of horrendous.
        The steady caravan of shiny new sports utility vehicles
        gave us no room at all, whizzing by at speeds that can
        only be described as unsafe. &quot;Why am I doing
        this?&quot; I thought. &quot;I really don&#146;t want to
        be here; if only I had a home to go back to&#133;&quot;
        Later Fred told me he was experiencing a similar <i>crise
        de foi. </i>Then, as if in a dream, we heard a distinctly
        friendly honk among the roar, and saw a couple furiously
        waving at us. It was Eric and Anne, the Britannic couple
        from the Nissos Kypros, and they wanted to buy us a beer.
        (<i>I was a little worried that timid and proper Eric and
        Anne had seen Andy flipping off nearly every motorist
        that passed - F) </i>We must have looked a pretty
        miserable sight, slick with sweat and grime and utterly
        frazzled by the traffic. Of course beer was out of the
        question, since we needed all our concentration if we
        wanted to survive this road, but we did accept iced
        coffee.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">I didn&#146;t realize how
        much I needed the break until we stopped, high atop a
        mountain in a place called Pissouri. It felt fantastic to
        be off the road and conversing with civilized people. The
        several bags of potato chips were a big help, too,
        replacing all the salt we&#146;d lost. At my insistence,
        Eric gave us a detailed hill- and traffic- profile of the
        road ahead, reassuring us that there were only a couple
        of more climbs. I hoped with every fiber of my being that
        it wasn&#146;t just British understatement, but he turned
        out to be right. From our coffee stop we plunged back
        down to sea level, with only a couple more climbs,
        neither of which held a candle to Pissouri in terms of
        nastiness. An added bonus was the beauty of the
        coastline, which distracted me somewhat from the noise of
        the evil autos that continued to scream by. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">At the alleged birthplace
        of Aphrodite we stopped for an ice cream and watched a
        foursome of vulgar, mafiaesque Russians cavort along the
        edge of the cliff. Nearing Pafos, the terrain evolved
        into something far more manageable, and a stiff wind at
        our backs had us there in no time, which was not a moment
        too soon.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Learning only yesterday
        that Cyprus is a big destination for Brits on package
        tours, I was completely unprepared for Pafos. I had
        included it on the itinerary in order to check out the
        supposedly famous mosaics here, not knowing that
        we&#146;d be staying in the Las Vegas of Cyprus for the
        privilege. A seemingly endless strip of resort hotels
        lined the coastline into the center of town, where we
        scored an apartment in a complex normally reserved for
        down-market package tours. When we walked out in search
        of dinner, we found ourselves surrounded by a veritable
        sea of Britannic tourist swill: fish-and-chips stands,
        bars advertising cheap pints and live rugby coverage,
        tacky souvenir shops.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Luckily we had a guide in
        the person of John. We met him the night before in
        Limassol, and he gave us his number in Pafos, where he
        has lived as a refugee from Dutch weather for five years
        now. He took us out for drinks in a fairly skanky outdoor
        bar and told us with great enthusiasm all about his
        libidnous exploits. Claiming to be just over fifty years
        old but looking two decades older, he manages to feed
        from a veritable cornucopia of young Cypriot boys. His
        latest boyfriend, he lamented, resides with his parents
        and lives in constant fear of being &quot;found
        out.&quot; Even John displayed a certain amount of
        circumspection, refusing to accompany us to Pafos&#146;s
        only &quot;gay bar&quot; on the grounds that &quot;I
        wouldn&#146;t want anyone to see me there.&quot;
        Expecting a den of iniquity, we were bitterly
        disappointed by the bar &#150;called
        &quot;Different&quot;&#151;which appeared to be the
        watering hole of choice for local yuppies and
        glamourbabes. Everyone but us was all gussied up for
        Saturday night, and the flamboyant bartender/owner seemed
        to be the only other homo around. On the positive side,
        the bar&#146;s total lack of appeal provided us with a
        good excuse to climb into our beds and read. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Our plan to ride up to the
        mountains the following day was frustrated by a string of
        thunderstorms and pounding rain. So we settled for a lazy
        day of poking around ruins and admiring the mosaics in
        our rainsuits, playing backgammon in cafes, gorging
        ourselves on a delicious Indian dinner, and not much
        else. </font></p>

        Pera-pedhi, 68 km (f)</b></font><p><font size="2" face="Arial">After our first day&#146;s ride in Cyprus I
        couldn&#146;t decide what seemed more absurd, the
        political situation here or the idea of riding a bike on
        this island. (A brief oral history of the situation here
        was relayed by Eric and Anne at our rest the other day.
        They lowered their voices a number of times so not to be
        overheard by others in the restaurant. Apparently the
        Greeks came down here and planted a seed of discontent in
        the brains of the recently liberated Cypriots. They
        proposed that it might be a great idea to have an all
        Greek government and maybe reunite with Greece. They
        seemed to forget about the fact that well over a third of
        the population here was Turkish and Muslim. They started
        persecuting the Turks and excluding them from the
        government. Looking at a map you may have noticed that
        Turkey is a little closer to Cyprus than Greece. If you
        have ever met a Turk you may know that they are a proud
        people and don&#146;t take well to seeing their own
        abused, hence their subsequent invasion and annexing of
        one-third of Cyprus should come as no surprise. Except if
        you are a Greek or Greek Cypriot and have your head
        deeply buried in the sand.)</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The ridiculousness of
        riding in Cyprus was not soon forgotten. We began roughly
        where we had ended two days earlier --on the hideously
        narrow road now joined by impatient weekday Cypriot
        drivers as well as a generous number of nervous tourists
        each in his rented Suzuki Samarai. I narrowly escaped
        being run over by a slow moving truck when I erroneously
        assumed that a blinking left hand turn signal meant that
        the driver intended to turn left. Silly me! Thankfully I
        was marginally faster than the truck and its wild-eyed
        driver and lived to tell this tale. I can&#146;t begin to
        tell you what the terrain along the road looked like
        because I have no memory of it except of the white line
        marking the highway edge and my effort trying to keep my
        bike as close to it as possible.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">After about 15K of torture
        we turned off the main highway onto a little road by a
        dam. At first we guessed that we&#146;d made a mistake.
        There were no drivers on the road. Just when we&#146;d
        become accustomed to riding as though our lives would end
        at any moment we suddenly found ourselves breathing,
        looking around and, remarkably, enjoying riding once
        again. It seemed strange what difference it was to ride a
        few meters from the main road. The cars that did pass us
        did so sanely, all the cars not just the timid tourists.
        This also marked the end of our sea-level ride. We began
        climbing abruptly and the altitude afforded us sweeping
        views across the brown brushy hills to the teal sea.
        Sweat poured off our bodies as we puffed up the canyon
        towards the mountains.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Miraculously, just as I
        began to feel as though I&#146;d perspired out all of my
        salt a little restaurant appeared. It turned out not to
        be a restaurant but a convenience store with a very
        limited selection of food. We were satisfied nonetheless
        by a package of cookies, two bags of chips and more
        beverages than you could shake a stick at. The shop keep
        spoke no English except to tell us the price of our
        consumption and repeatedly tell us that they had no
        sandwiches. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Some three hundred meters
        higher up the mountain we found another
        &quot;restaurant&quot;. This one run by a woman with
        brillo pads for hair and loads of cats roaming around her
        yard. She made us nasty canned lunch meat sandwiches
        while Andy played with the cats. I watched in amusement
        while his eyes turned red from his allergies. He cried
        and sneezed while demonstrating the &quot;international
        kitty pet&quot; to the locals and feeding the little
        pregos his luncheon meat. The cats were greatly satisfied
        by the attention Andy gave if not by our lunch which one
        nearly gagged on.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">After lunch the road
        pitched upward at an even steeper grade. We pumped and
        dripped through dinky villages full of women dressed like
        nuns and their mustached husbands. Judging by their
        reactions of disbelief our kind of travel is not
        commonplace here or they were shocked that we hadn&#146;t
        been run over already on the main road. We ascended to
        860 meters before leveling off and gradually descending.
        After only 60km I was already a bit tired and ready to
        call it a day. Andy, in contrast, exclaimed that he could
        ride an equal distance and climb an equal amount before
        stopping for the night. Just the same, we had the option
        of climbing further and riding another five kilometers or
        descending to the next village to call it a day. Andy
        voted for descent and I could hardly disagree. It was the
        fastest five kilometers I&#146;d ridden in a long time.
        Reaching speeds over 60km/h we zipped into Pera-Pedhi.
        Traveling so fast we almost completely overshot the
        village until stopping at its edge in search of a place
        to lodge for the night. For a few moments we were worried
        that we might have to back-track the five km up to the
        last village and ride another five km up because we
        couldn&#146;t find anyplace to stay. I wouldn&#146;t call
        the villagers exactly warm and helpful either. Two
        loafing octogenarians opted to make lewd gestures at
        Andrew rather than help us locate a room. Another told us
        that there were no rooms in town (ironically we saw him
        drinking later in the restaurant of the pension we ended
        up staying in).</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Defeated and tired (even
        though Andy &quot;could ride another 60km and climb
        another 1200 meters&quot;) we began to backtrack up the
        hill. Just before leaving the village we came upon a sign
        advertising rooms and scrambled up the dirt driveway to
        inquire about them. Nick, the owner, and his snarling dog
        Wolfie greeted us smiling. Nick showed us a &quot;just
        completed&quot; room and a place for our bikes and we
        were sold. He offered to make us a roasted chicken for
        dinner and I was more than satisfied. So what if the room
        would never be featured in Architectural Digest, the pink
        plaid comforters and matching towels would do the trick
        and left us wondering if Nick was widowed or a little
        light in his loafers.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">After check-in and before
        dinner I went on with the laborious task of finishing
        &quot;Beloved&quot; by Toni Morrison while Andrew caught
        up on writing his delinquent passages. If she can win a
        Nobel Prize&#133;.</font></p>

        to Nicosia, 83km (a)</b></font><p><font size="2" face="Arial">Getting out of bed proved a difficult task
        this morning; we could practically see our breath in the
        cold mountain air that filled our room, and padding
        around on the tile floor felt like walking on ice. While
        Fred went through his usual busy morning routine, I
        remained buried deep under my covers until I heard our
        host knocking around in the kitchen below us, hopefully
        preparing our coffee. Munching on our toast, we learned
        from the t.v. that the Dow Jones Industrial Average had
        dropped over five hundred points while we slept, an event
        which felt impossibly remote here in the Cypriot
        hinterland. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">I knew from the map that
        this morning would entail a six-hundred meter climb, but
        not before making a major withdrawal from the altitude
        bank. Still dazed after a single cup of nasty nescafe, I
        couldn&#146;t fully appreciate the chilly, curving
        descent into Saitas, over two hundred meters below Chez
        Nick. The ensuing climb woke me up though. Our legs still
        felt rubbery from yesterday&#146;s climbing so we felt
        every push of the pedal up the relentless 10km ascent. At
        the top my altimeter read 1150 meters. We paused at a
        traileresque snack stand for some salty snacks and a
        healthy dose of chilly mountain air before dressing
        ourselves for the long ride down.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Twisting down the slopes
        at the same speed as the motor traffic, I kept marveling
        that we&#146;d managed to climb so high in just over an
        hour. While I thought we&#146;d visit a couple of
        villages and their famous painted churches on the way
        down, we changed our mind about being tourists in the
        Brit-infested town of Kakopetria, where touts in front of
        cookie-cutter tavernas greeted us with &quot;hello my
        friend&quot; as we whizzed down the steep street. Poorly
        marked by befuddling road signs, the churches either
        eluded us or were atop impossibly steep hills. After
        convincing ourselves that they couldn&#146;t be as
        impressive as the many old churches we had seen in
        Turkey, we opted to continue down towards Nicosia,
        capital of this screwed-up country and supposedly the
        world&#146;s only remaining &quot;divided city.&quot;</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Traffic picked up as we
        descended towards the arid, undulating plain containing
        Nicosia and its confusing mess of suburbs. The road was
        obviously new, a replacement for the useless old road now
        bisected numerous times by the green line. Propaganda
        billboards lined our route, as well as abandoned buses
        from now-Turkish towns, signs forbidding the taking of
        photographs, and a string of lookout towers both Greek
        and Turkish. The many UN vehicles passing us completed
        the impression that we had entered a zone fraught with
        conflict. Finally, we were in the Cyprus of my
        media-driven expectations.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">These impressions grew
        increasingly stronger as we approached Nicosia. My map
        showed a quieter alternative to the main road, but after
        a blissful kilometer&#146;s pedal the route was barred by
        masses of barbed wire and unfriendly signage. It struck
        us as odd that the road had been marked as leading to
        &quot;Nicosia International Airport&quot; (and odder
        still when we learned that this airport has been
        abandoned due to its placement in the &quot;buffer
        zone&quot;). In any case, this forced us back onto the
        main road, which promptly turned into a freeway filled
        with Mario Andretti wannabes. Off in the distance an
        enormous Turkish Cypriot flag made of white rocks covered
        the better part of a mountain, an unmistakable &quot;fuck
        you&quot; to South Nicosia. Later we learned that this
        landmark had been created by survivors of a particularly
        brutal massacre of a Turkish village at the hands of
        Greek Cypriots. Visible from miles around, it serves as a
        constant reminder for Turks and Greeks alike, though the
        two factions doubtless have widely varying
        interpretations of its significance.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">After many bewildering
        twists and turns in the route, we finally found our way
        into the heart of town. Since it was a holiday (marking
        the anniversary of Mussolini&#146;s declaration of war on
        Greece), the tourist information booth was closed, making
        us rely upon the lodging advice of a friendly waiter at a
        touristy taverna. After settling in at Tony&#146;s
        cramped-but-homey Bed and Breakfast, we walked around the
        old part of town (delineated by an incredibly intact
        11-bastioned Venetian wall, of which five bastions each
        have been allocated to the Turks and Greeks respectively,
        the eleventh under UN control). The green line beckoned
        us like a magnet, cutting right through avenues and
        streets of what used to be the town&#146;s commercial
        center, marked by crude sandbag bunkers and eerily dark
        guardposts. It&#146;s like a Lilliputian pre-unification
        Berlin, ridiculous &#150;almost cutesy&#151;in scale but
        deadly serious as a palpable barrier of hate. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Most of Nicosia&#146;s
        center (at least on the Greek side) has an abandoned,
        ghost-town feel to it, not unlike Saint Louis or Detroit.
        Fred and I kept marveling aloud how creepy it felt, and
        how weird and unhealthy it would be to grow up in such a
        place. As if to prove our point, a mad motorist appeared
        out of nowhere along a deserted, darkened street, gunning
        his motor and acting as if wanting to mow us down. When
        he rounded the block and turned up again, we noted his
        licence plate (AAE123) and after a long standoff in which
        he stayed parked at an intersection while we screamed
        that we&#146;d call the police, he mercifully let us
        alone. We were shaken up enough to pick up a couple of
        rocks in case he came around again and made a point of
        staying on busier streets thereafter. In a sick sort of
        way, I was thrilled to have Nicosia live up to my
        expectations, though it&#146;s hardly a place I&#146;d
        choose for a prolonged vacation.</font></p>

    <tr>
        <td><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>The Turkish Republic
        of North Cyprus (f)</b></font><p><font size="2" face="Arial">I&#146;d anticipated this day since our
        arrival in Cyprus. My imagination went into overtime. I
        gathered that we&#146;d have to jump through hoops, spit
        nickels, be strip searched, interrogated, embarrassed and
        cajoled in order to pass the border. In execution it
        turned out to be markedly easier than getting information
        about ferry schedules in Athens. We simply walked to the
        border, registered on the Greek side, passed immigration
        on the Turkish side, bought our visas and walked across
        the green line.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">There were a few
        remarkable sights along the way that did leave an
        impression. First many of the buildings just before the
        border on the Greek side had undergone trauma. Their
        blemishes and wounds ranged from gunshot induced chips in
        plaster to roofs ripped off from mortar fire. Many had
        anti-Turkish graffiti including intellectual barbs like
        &quot;suck my Greek dick you murdering Turkish
        pigs.&quot; Huge billboards decorated the Greek border
        with graphic color photos of bloodied bodies of innocent
        Greeks. One was beaten to death on the Turkish side
        leaving a pregnant wife. Strangely there was no detail as
        to why a hoard of Turks might have decided to beat him to
        death or the circumstance of his visit to the Turkish
        side, leading us to question their propaganda.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">After crossing the Greek
        border and passing menacing tangles of razor wire we
        entered the UN buffer zone, strangely the first building
        we came to was the German Cultural Center. I wondered to
        myself about many visitors they receive in this location.
        Next, a formerly glamorous hotel, its carved limestone
        facade pockmarked by gun and mortar fire now house a
        contingent of UN peace keepers. Leaving the
        propaganda-free zone (the UN buffer zone) passing yet
        another nest of razor wire and a dozing robin&#146;s egg
        blue hatted UN guard we entered the Turkish Republic of
        North Cyprus (TRNC). Immediately we were greeted by
        display cases with black and white photos showing
        atrocities committed by the Greeks. Frankly they were
        better propaganda vehicles than the flashy Greek ones.
        Their matter of fact presentation clearly detailed the
        who, what, when, where and why&#146;s of the situation.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">After the drama of the
        crossing the rest of the visit seemed largely
        anticlimactic. The north side of the city was much
        sleepier than the south. Apparently few Turks live on
        this side of the city. Underscoring this fact is that the
        Turks have imported Anatolians from the mainland to
        inhabit the city. The first thing that struck me was the
        civility of the traffic compared to the south. I found
        myself marveling at how quiet the streets were and how
        calm the drivers were. We encountered only a few cases of
        BCS (Big Car Syndrome &#150; where the owner of a fancy
        vehicle imagines that he bought the road and the right to
        maim along with his expensive car) while in the TRNC. We
        did encounter lots of the same friendly, easy going,
        honest and clean Turks like the ones we&#146;d met in
        Turkey. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Unfortunately our sight
        seeing would be limited to the outside of many buildings.
        We&#146;d come to the TRNC on a very special day, the
        anniversary of the death of their revered deceased leader
        Ataturk, founder of modern Turkey. We arrived at the one
        gate through city walls on the Turkish side to see a
        massive gathering of army personnel and civilians
        commemorating this day. Huge banners proclaiming their
        relationship with the &quot;motherland&quot;, Turkish
        flags and balloons decorated the square. We listened to
        the military band play &quot;taps&quot; and the crowd sob
        while the flag was lowered and raised again in
        Ataturk&#146;s honor. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">From the demonstration we
        walked down the main street to an eight story hotel in
        the center of town. There we went to the top to see the
        view of both sides of the green line from above. From
        this vantage point you could see the disheveled buildings
        in the buffer zone decaying from disuse. Among them is
        rumored to be a warehouse full of &quot;new&quot; 1974
        Toyotas and Nissans. They were supposedly rushed to their
        resting place there from Famagusta as they were
        partitioning the country. They were thought to be safer
        here than in the new Turkish port there. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Further wanderings
        revealed architectural curiosities like the massive
        Venetian gothic churches that were hastily converted into
        mosques. Their bell towers converted to minarets and
        their worship spaces re-oriented to face Mecca. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Somehow I couldn&#146;t
        find a single smelly, dirty, mean and violent Turk that I
        had been warned about. What we did manage to find was a
        very tasty pide (Turkish pizza). Crescent shaped, filled
        with goat cheese and lamb sausage, it made a yummy picnic
        in front of the cloisters of one of the gothic mosques.
        Strolling along the green line of the TRNC we saw no
        armed soldiers as we had on the other side. We speculated
        that they were either much more lax about the patrol of
        the border, or that everyone was celebrating
        Ataturk&#146;s holiday. In any case we were afforded many
        opportunities to photograph the green line from this
        side.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Even though the day in the
        TRNC had gone without a hitch, I approached our crossing
        back to the Greek side with trepidation. I worried about
        the photos we&#146;d taken of the line and confusion
        about our digital camera. In actuality the trip back was
        even easier than the trip there. We simply walked through
        the border largely unquestioned by either side except to
        view our passports.</font></p>

        Limassol, 85 km (f)</b></font><p><font size="2" face="Arial">At breakfast in the rooftop garden of
        Tony&#146;s B&amp;B we munched fried eggs, slurped
        Nescafe and readied ourselves for the day ahead. We met a
        couple of Dutch travelers and convinced them that it was
        easy to get to the Turkish Republic of North Cyprus
        (TRNC) and told them how to get there before departing. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">As for the ride, Andy had
        told me that it would be an easy day, only 85 kilometers
        and &quot;pretty flat&quot;. I found myself huffing and
        puffing climbing out of Nicosia as we pedaled over
        rolling hills. Fortunately the traffic was more
        respectful than I thought they&#146;d be and the road
        better. The landscape of suburban Nicosia is not worth
        mention. Some have compared it to Los Angeles, but I
        think Eastern Europe suburbs are a better comparison.
        We&#146;d opted to take the old road to Limassol, leaving
        the superhighway to the leadfooted masses. The first part
        of this route was not much prettier than the suburbs of
        the city. Dominated by industrial sprawl I began to
        wonder if the whole trip would be like this. Good fortune
        smiled upon us and warehouses gave way to rural
        landscapes. Scrubby bushes and eucalyptus trees covered
        the hills and I was reminded of my origins in Southern
        California.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Before long we&#146;d
        pedaled half way to Limasol helped along by stiff tail
        winds. We stopped for souvlaki and chicken shish at a
        roadside stand having a beer and a game of backgammon for
        dessert. I was so full after lunch the hills seemed
        insurmountable. Further complicating matters, the wind
        seemed to have shifted 180 degrees and was now blowing in
        our face. We climbed and fell over and over again finally
        making it to our tourist stop for the day, the Neolithic
        ruins of Kakopetria. Though probably very interesting to
        the archeologists who discovered them and the historians
        analyzing them the outdoor museum looked like JAPOR to us
        (just another pile of rocks). The fantastic mosaics and
        remains of buildings seen at other Greek, Roman and
        Byzantine sights had spoiled us. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">In the afternoon we were
        greeted with a headwind that rendered the
        afternoon&#146;s ride into Limasol a challenge. Still we
        hustled down to the coast after a few very satisfying
        downhills. The very last part of the ride was nearly
        unbearable. Fifteen kilometers past a seemingly endless
        chain of tourist hotels ranging from elegant to trashy.
        Torrents of tourist-filled cars and busses whooshed by us
        numbing us to the beauty of the beaches and coast we
        passed. Andy said it made Paphos look charming in
        comparison. Back in Limassol we looked forward to a day
        of relaxation and a trip to Stellios&#146; fantastic bar.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">At the bar we met a young
        and handsome soldier with a clear picture of his mission
        in the army. When asked what he&#146;d do if he saw a
        Turk he said &quot; I&#146;d not shoot him. I would stick
        him with my knife and drink his blood!&quot; Still we
        found him charming somehow, but so much for a peacefully
        unified island.</font><font size="2"> </font></p>
