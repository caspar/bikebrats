        <td><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>23 August, Suwalki to
        Elk, 81km</b></font><p><font size="2" face="Arial">I woke
        up groggy this morning after sleeping badly in our commie
        era hotel. Our entry into Suwalki yesterday revealed a
        town of a million shares of gray. The stunningly
        beautiful countryside stands in stark contrast to the
        nearly disgusting towns. Looks like Hitler and Stalin
        left a horrific architectural legacy on poor Poland. <i>(For
        those of you who don&#146;t know the evil story, both
        perpetrated incredible horrors on the populations of this
        area. First the Germans pummeled Poland. The exiled
        Polish government struck up a deal with the Russians to
        oust the Germans. The Russians ignored their agreement to
        cooperate as soon as they saw that the Polish had
        independent aspirations. The brave Soviet forces watched
        the Germans make mincemeat of the Polish army from just
        over the border. After the Polish forces suffered some
        200,000 casualties and the Germans systematically burned
        Warsaw the valiant Russians stepped in to
        &quot;liberate&quot; the Poles.)</i></font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Our breakfast was in
        another Soviet-style dining room. This time the
        management had tried to redecorate using camouflage
        netting to cover a decaying ceiling. The server did her
        absolute best to minimize contact with us and again Andy
        was left wanting another cup of his morning addiction. I
        was happy to hit the road. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Today the countryside
        seemed even more picturesque, especially since we
        weren&#146;t rushing to beat the sunset like the evening
        before. Yesterday Andy noticed a stork in a field as we
        rode along, and we&#146;d also seen their massive nests
        atop telephone poles but not made the connection between
        the two. Today we saw many storks atop barns, houses and
        utility poles. Often they were with their mates tending
        to their young. It looked like the farmers had made
        special accommodations for the big white birds, which
        left us wondering if they represented good luck for the
        residents.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Today I was still fearing
        drivers. Not only did they behave as badly as the
        Lithuanians, but they also appeared to be spatially
        impaired. Today a lovely Lada wagon raced past me, then
        hit his brakes hard and swerved right onto the shoulder
        in front of me in order to make a spontaneous U-turn,
        forcing me off the road. The day before I tried to figure
        out how to menace the drivers into being more
        considerate. I composed this threat, &quot;Yeah!, come
        any closer with your new Audi and I&#146;ll get my blood
        all over your shiny car and then flip end-over-end like a
        pinwheel helplessly through the fields.&quot; We have
        determined that the biggest buttheads drive Audis and we
        cringe anytime we see one. I am thinking about trying to
        get a stork to nest on my bike to bring me some good
        luck.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Olecko, our lunch spot,
        came pretty quickly despite our roadside dramas. We
        looked for a lunch spot, came upon a charming little
        restaurant on the way into town and decided to see what
        we could find in the center. What we did find was the
        worst pizza in the East. Our sidewalk meal was not
        without redeeming value, since it did provide a great
        people-watching opportunity. Olecko&#146;s natural beauty
        and lakeside setting appear to draw many Polish tourists.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">A navigational error on
        the way out of town turned out to be another gorgeous
        mistake. It placed us on a tree-canopied road through the
        most rural area, where the only other traffic was Stosh
        on his tractor on his way to reap his wheat. Before long
        we were in Elk and ready to call it a short day. We
        decided to find a little snack before seeking lodging. At
        the train station we shared a hot dog that would have its
        own zip code if found in the States.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Finding a hotel was not as
        easy as we anticipated. First we tried to find one that
        looked like it should be on an island of the lake. It
        turned out to be in yet another ugly residential area on
        a road paved in massive concrete blocks that didn&#146;t
        quite fit together. The sensation caused by the pavement
        was like riding on a path cobbled with the world's
        largest stones. As we fled this nasty burb we were chased
        by a persistent little barking gnat of a dog. It liked
        Andy&#146;s pepper spray so much it came back for a
        second helping.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Our next stop was an
        upscale affair on the lake that looked deserted, however
        the desk clerk told me that they were full but we could
        check back at 8pm. He told us about the two other hotels
        in town, one being the one we&#146;d seen on pepper
        poodle lane and the other up the street. We decided to
        check out the Zodiak Hotel upon his recommendation and
        discovered a hotel that was built and furnished during
        the communist administration. We decided to press our
        luck and returned to the upscale lakeside one. We sat and
        drank beers on their terrace by the lake until eight and
        then asked for our room. The clerk told Andy that the
        cancellation had been called in hours before and asked if
        we really wanted our room now. (duh!?, no we&#146;d like
        to sit out here dirty and sweaty and be eaten alive by
        the mosquitoes.)</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">While we waited we met an
        American girl and her Polish boyfriend. Karolyn and
        Martin run the Yahoo-like Internet service of Poland (</font><a href="http://www.polishworld.com" target="contents"><font size="2" face="Arial">www.PolishWorld.com</font></a><font size="2" face="Arial">). They shared some great secrets on how to
        get connected in Warsaw and offered to show us around
        town when we get there later in the week. We munched in
        the hotel restaurant because it was the only place in
        town that would take credit cards. Our communications
        with the waitress were limited to our very bad German and
        much gesticulation. Even in the face of our limited
        vocabulary everything came as we asked except Andy&#146;s
        beer which was warm. This left Andrew pondering why he
        has such bad beverage Karma. We retreated to the room,
        opting to skip the disco that came highly recommended by
        the barman in favor of an evening at home with NBC Europe
        and our computer.</font></p>

        <td><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>24 August, Elk to
        Lomza, 99 km</b></font><p><font size="2" face="Arial">We
        were the center of attention, surrounded by over a dozen
        young men, several of them bare-chested and all wanting
        to talk to us and buy us drinks. Unfortunately, this
        scene&#146;s being completely outside of any queer
        context made it mostly unpleasant, even claustrophobic.
        We had stopped at a roadside refreshment stand and ersatz
        bar in Radzilow, a godforsaken shithole if there ever was
        one. Our fellow patrons were all hopelessly wasted, and
        most of them looked like they&#146;d spent last night in
        a nearby gutter, but our arrival on the scene was enough
        to shake them from their alcoholic stupor. We might as
        well have been invading aliens for all the stir we
        caused, and I&#146;m sure that those among them who
        remain conscious (if there are any, that is) are still
        talking about it now. Most of them spoke loudly to us in
        Polish or used course pantomime (e.g. sticking the
        business end of a bottle of vodka in our faces and
        insisting we drink). Only one teenager among them spoke a
        few words of English, &quot;motherfucker&quot; being a
        favorite. There was also an older guy spoke to us in bad
        Spanish, who told us he had lived in Madrid for five
        years and that we could call him Juan. We kept trying to
        explain to our overly friendly hosts that we
        couldn&#146;t drink if we were expected to ride another
        50 kilometers. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">This event marked the
        middle of an otherwise unremarkable day. It was a lot
        like yesterday, with the same strong wind blowing in our
        faces, the same warm temperature and summery feeling to
        the air, the same pastoral splendor all around us. Has
        Poland already lost its gloss of exoticism for us? </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">I suppose the day
        wasn&#146;t entirely without distractions. Heading out of
        town this morning we passed two churches belching out
        mass-goers. There were so many that I wondered how they
        could all fit inside, and said a silent prayer hoping
        that the priest&#146;s sermon had extolled the virtues of
        safe driving. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Drivers weren&#146;t a big
        issue today, though. The roads we took were very calm for
        the most part, but for this we had to pay a price, since
        the surfaces of Poland&#146;s secondary road system are
        cobbled, bumpy, buckled, potholed, or worse. It&#146;s a
        day I&#146;ll remember more with my sore butt than with
        my brain. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">While we ate lunch in
        Grajewo (we ordered schnitzel again, it being the only
        thing we recognized on the menu) we watched a blind man
        walk by on the street outside encounter our bikes &#150;a
        major obstacle. An hour&#146;s ride beyond was where the
        really bad roads began, and by the time we stopped for
        our encounter with the <i>jeunesse dorée</i> of
        Radzilow, we were pretty well rattled, seriously
        wondering if we (and our bikes) would arrive intact in
        Lomza, still 42 kilometers away. Miraculously, the last
        hour of riding was relatively smooth sailing. I still had
        to stand up in my pedals half the time to give my poor
        taint a rest (&quot;taint&quot; is Bratese for perineum,
        i.e. the part of the body that is most intimately
        connected to one&#146;s bicycle seat). For what felt like
        the first time today, I caught myself admiring my
        surroundings rather than bemoaning the miserable state of
        the road. There were huge pyramids of hay everywhere, and
        farmers plying the roads with tractors. We played
        leap-frog with one such vehicle for a long time over the
        rolling terrain. Inside it were a farmer and his wife,
        causing Fred to theorize they were on their way into town
        for an elegant Sunday dinner.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Lomza &#150;the sleepy
        provincial capital where we&#146;re staying
        tonight&#151;is situated above the deeply-cut valley of
        the Narew River. It wasn&#146;t hard finding a place to
        stay, with the familiar Soviet-style hotel visible for
        miles around. Checking in, a squat little old dude
        hovered around like a fly, offering to help us with our
        bikes. First he showed us a closet near the lobby, which
        looked fine, but when it came time to park the bikes he
        led us back outside and proceeded to load them into a
        little shack in the middle of the hotel&#146;s parking
        lot. Unable to communicate and exhausted from the
        day&#146;s bumpy ride, we decided to put our fate in
        hands of this earnest little parking gnome. &quot;He must
        be working us for a tip&quot;, Fred and I both thought
        aloud, in the eerie simultaneous way that comes from
        being around each other twenty-four hours a day. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">No such person came
        forward to assist us with the dining process. Our hotel
        is full of young athletes in town for some event or
        another, and the staff refused to let us eat in the
        dining room. Fred had to make a small scene &#150;which I
        thankfully didn&#146;t have to witness&#151;in order to
        get us served in the bar. The food was decent and there
        was an approximate English translation of the menu, upon
        which three of the desserts were listed simply as
        &quot;ice cream,&quot; while a fourth was mysteriously
        differentiated as &quot;ice cream dessert.&quot; We
        ordered the latter since it was more expensive, and then
        headed out for a walk around town and a bottle of
        drinkable water.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Lomza is pretty quiet on a
        Sunday night, apart from the heavy traffic on the highway
        to Warsaw. From the unlit streets, it looked attractive
        enough, with lots of green squares and older buildings.
        The only market we found open was doing a brisk business,
        and we were disappointed to find they only carry fizzy
        water (flat bottled water is a rare commodity in these
        parts, and we hoard it when we find it). </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Feeling we had pretty much
        exhausted Lomza&#146;s night-time offerings, we slumped
        our way back to our room, where Fred snores behind me as
        I type in the dark. </font></p>

        Ostroleka/Warsaw</b></font><p><font size="2" face="Arial">I
        had looked forward to this day especially after the
        yesterday&#146;s rough and windy ride. My butt was still
        screaming over the bumpiness of yesterday&#146;s road,
        though I could hardly hear its complaints over those of
        my quads. We&#146;d anticipated rolling out of bed,
        packing up our bikes and taking the train into Warsaw.
        Neither of us had relished the idea of riding 150
        kilometers on a busy highway full of Polish urban
        drivers. We&#146;d come to this decision when we entered
        our first Polish town, where I was almost run down by a
        taxi driver who seemed to be in a coma while driving.
        Graphic signs on the roadside depicting cars hitting both
        people and one another confirmed for us that even the
        Poles know that driving skill is at issue here.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Andrew was just a little
        disappointed. He had hoped that we could ride from
        Tallinn to Turkey without using any form of
        transportation other than our bikes. Integrity of the
        ride was overridden by concern for our safety.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">We sauntered down to the
        restaurant anticipating cold cuts, cabbage, cucumbers,
        canned juice and bread like every other breakfast for the
        last dozen days. The experience was surprisingly
        different. First, our waiter was about the warmest one
        we&#146;d encountered. Not only was he polite, but a menu
        offered us a choice of a hot breakfast. After munching
        some half-heartedly scrambled eggs (more like a fried egg
        that someone broke the yoke on) and ham we put the
        friendly staff to the test. Andrew asked for another
        helping of coffee. The waiter grinned and within a few
        minutes came back with two cups of refreshingly warm
        caffeinated beverages and a bill for 10 zloties. I was
        happy to pay for it and savored my second cup and the
        simple fact that it was available. Am I becoming addicted
        to the morning mud like Andy?</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Andy went to the travel
        office next door to find out the train schedule and
        exchange some greenbacks while I packed. I decided to
        stop by the front desk to ask a question. One can only
        imagine my disappointment when the desk clerk told me
        that we&#146;d have to ride on to another to catch the
        train to Warsaw. I raced over to the travel office to
        find Andy. On my way over the parking lot mafia dude
        grabbed me and stuffed a twently (whopping) zlot invoice
        for attending to our bicycles. Alternatively I cursed our
        logistic predicament and my foolishness for not sniffing
        out the parking rip-off the night before. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Approaching the Orbis
        Travel office I saw Andy looking puzzled while waiting
        outside. I noticed a woman scurrying about inside looking
        out occasionally at him through the locked door. Andy
        recounted how he had come up to the front door hearing
        her frantic steps behind him. Reaching for the door she
        nearly shoved him out of the way, opened the door,
        slammed it behind her and told him to wait there. When I
        informed Andy of our plight, we decided to abort our
        first visit to the Polish National Tourist Bureau. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">While I loaded my bike in
        front of the hotel the sleazy parking dude hovered over
        me as though I would run off without paying him the
        protection money he demanded. Can&#146;t say it
        didn&#146;t cross my mind, since the whole thing reeked
        of impropriety. While I exchanged pleasantries with the
        parking mafia Andy handled our transportation crisis. He
        learned that the nearest town with a rail connection
        (whose name sounded like the fat-free fat substitute
        Olestra) was 45 kilometers away and asked the hotel
        worker to find out the schedule. According to Andy&#146;s
        watch we had a mere hour and a half to make the 45K
        distance. Otherwise, there would be a five hour wait for
        the next train. Hmmm, that would mean that we&#146;d have
        to beat our fastest daily average ever to make the train,
        which seemed an unlikely event.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Once on the road we found
        that the wind had shifted 180 degrees. It was now blowing
        us along as we pumped as hard as we could down the busy
        and narrow highway. Strangely the traffic seemed less
        menacing as we raced along at nearly 30k/h. The goal of
        making the next town became more reasonable as we watched
        our average speed climb. After about 25K it became
        apparent that we would most likely make our train. Andrew
        had been riding in my jet stream and remarked that it he
        &quot;wasn&#146;t even having to push it.&quot; I invited
        him to lead for a few kilometers. I was definitely
        &quot;pushing it&quot; and sweat was dripping off my nose
        readily as we cruised down the highway.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Not knowing where to find
        the station in Olestra was our undoing. We essed about
        the town asking various people where to find it until we
        finally came upon the tracks and saw the station. The
        only issue was that we were five minutes late for the
        train when we huffed into the station. The sales clerk
        looked at us as though we&#146;d lost our minds. I
        can&#146;t imagine what we looked like. Sweat was
        dripping off of me, I was nervous and breathing hard. We
        thought that we had missed the train by moments and asked
        when the next train was. The friendly (genuinely) woman
        behind the counter didn&#146;t speak English well wrote
        the time of the train we were trying to make from Lomza.
        Something didn&#146;t make sense, the train should have
        left at least five minutes before. &quot;No, really, when
        is the next train?,&quot; We asked more emphatically. She
        shrugged, and pointed to her note and then the clock in
        the station which showed the time one hour earlier than
        Andrew&#146;s watch. We&#146;d been in Poland for three
        nights not knowing that the time had changed when we
        crossed the Border from the Baltics. (Andrew thinks this
        time change is the reason that the Polish authorities
        held us up at the border for an hour; in this country
        where nothing comes for free, they weren&#146;t about to
        let us get away with a free hour).</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">An hour later we were on
        our way to Warsaw. The train itself was a rustic affair
        with more in common with a tractor than a train, its
        solid plastic red bench seats evoking a communist era
        feel. The ambiance inside the train was more like the
        village square than a form of transportation. All the
        peasants knew one another and conversed, shared food and
        helped one another board their baggage as we rattled down
        the tracks. The train stopped every five minutes in the
        most unlikely places. Often we&#146;d pause in the middle
        of a field next to a cow or rows of wheat where no one
        would get on or off. Through most of the ride the four
        women next to us chatted and ate. I have never seen so
        many sausages and sandwiches consumed by so few people.
        Admittedly I was a little jealous; we&#146;d only had a
        meager snack at the train station. One of the country
        women had bought a soft drink in Olestra and none of them
        could figure out how to open it and asked me to help.
        Two-thirds of the way through the voyage the train
        stopped and everyone hopped over to the next quay to
        change trains for the final ascent into Poland&#146;s
        capital. It was easy for most, but a little more
        complicated with our 100 pound (40 some-odd kilogram)
        bicycles. We had to lower them from the train, down to
        the ground from the platform, then up to the next
        platform, and finally into the new train. A helpful older
        Pole helped us load our bikes onto the new train that
        looked suspiciously like the last. After three hours of
        travel I&#146;d finished my book and we were rolling into
        the outskirts of Warsaw. It would have taken only a
        little while longer for us to have ridden our bikes into
        town.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The suburbs looked just as
        I remembered. Gray housing blocks and factories were
        surrounded by more of the same. It was a little shocking
        to come into a big city from the solitude of the
        countryside. The station and square were very busy, as
        were all the streets of Warsaw. On our ride the day
        before I&#146;d joked that we&#146;d have a Burger King
        lunch when we arrived in town. I was craving a hamburger.
        As we wound our way up a steep hill that leads from the
        river to the city&#146;s center, a vision greeted us: a
        Burger King with a terrace next to a cyber café. It
        seemed like a sign from the almighty, so we stopped in
        for a little dose of America.</font></p>

        </td>
        <td><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>26-29 August, Warsaw</b></font><p><font size="2" face="Arial">It had been five or six years since
        I had been to Warsaw and the change was remarkable. My
        last time here the streets and shops were gray and empty.
        I had considered Warsaw to be one of the saddest places
        on earth. It looked uglier than Los Angeles. Still, now
        as then, Warsaw is clearly designed for cars, huge
        boulevards criss-cross the city, culminating in the
        center where a huge Stalinist tower dominates the square.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The city has changed
        phenomenally, it doesn&#146;t seem sad at all. Active,
        busy and thriving are the words I would use to describe
        it. The bustling new shopping artery that leads from the
        center to the old city is alive and colorful. Shoppers
        peruse wide varieties of goods in stylish boutiques and
        refresh themselves at hip little cafes. Capillary walking
        streets feed the busier artery that leads to the old
        town. I remembered this street as shabby and ugly and was
        happily surprised to see this new vitality. The center
        square of the old town which I recalled as the diamond in
        the pile of sand that was Warsaw glitters more
        brilliantly than before. The once empty square is now
        filled with terrace restaurants and public benches. At
        night it fills with people eating, drinking, walking, and
        talking. The sounds of their activity bounce off the
        buildings and their colorful facades, lending a lively
        atmosphere to a beautiful spot. At night young lovers
        walk the ramparts and treat onlookers to intimacy that
        might better be reserved for their bedrooms or hotels.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Still, amongst all the
        prosperity there are signs that there is some distance to
        go. Wandering among the crowds of cell-phone-toting
        yuppies are many homeless and indigents. There are just a
        few more dirty mothers using their equally dirty and
        pathetic looking children to solicit cash than you would
        find in most other European capitals. Straying off the
        &quot;Disney&quot; track in Warsaw you&#146;ll still come
        upon buildings that recall the previous regime and its
        utilitarian architectural leanings. Soviet era gray block
        buildings and underground arcades host an unusual mix of
        traditional variety stores and western fast-food
        establishments. The little local Seven-Eleven style
        stores still operate under the Eastern shopping
        conventions. All the goods lie behind the counter and the
        shop keep helps you find the goods you want. This system
        promotes interaction but makes you feel helpless as a
        foreigner if you are unable to articulate what you need
        or want.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">This is a town that was
        not created with the pedestrian in mind. Cars zing along
        the wide streets at astounding speeds. Drivers dripping
        with testosterone gun their engines and spin the wheels
        of their shiny new western vehicles with alarming
        frequency, scaring pedestrians onto the sidewalks. The
        effect is that there are huge insurmountable canyons
        separating the sidewalks on either sides of the
        boulevards. The crevasses can only be crossed by braving
        the zebra-stripe crossings or the dreary pedestrian
        underpasses. A walk across any street in a crossing or
        out is a test of will between the pedestrian and the
        driver. No drivers stop or even appear as though they
        might unless you walk into the street as though you
        intend not to stop. Only then will drivers yield
        unwillingly. The last moment before they stop I find
        myself wondering whether I should run, stop or continue
        my path.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">We had a night out with
        our new found friends Martin and Karolyn whom we met a
        few days before in Elk. Martin took us out for a
        traditional Polish meal. I ate duck that was tasted like
        a simple countryside confit de canard. And the dinner
        washed down well with a cool, large and tasty Polish
        beer. Karolyn joined us late with one of her Polish
        students whom she tutors in English. Her dour student,
        though young, acted old and reminded me of a spinster.
        She voiced her disdain for tourists, admitting she
        didn&#146;t understand what benefit they provided to her
        country. After dinner we hit the cyber-café to talk a
        little shop and show off our respective web sites. Ours
        feels a little shabby next to the slick diversity of
        theirs. I had to remind myself that our primary purpose
        is travel not the web, but it left me wishing we had more
        time to make the BikeBrats site more beautiful and easier
        to use.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">We had another date with
        queer Warsaw later that night. We were off to the only
        homo nightspot open during the week, the Kozla Pub. It
        has an ambiance somewhere between a basement recreation
        room and a picnic. The small underground room has a few
        wooden tables and was filled with happy Poles enjoying
        the night out. At first I felt like I was an uninvited
        guest at a BBQ. All of the patrons seemed to be hanging
        out in cliques and not very open to meeting others. After
        a few beers we became more aggressive and were able to
        meet many new friends who opened up if approached. We met
        two brothers, one straight and the other gay. The gay law
        student seemed more conventional and boring than his
        brother, who smiled and joked with us. As usual, the
        ex-pat crew was much more welcoming to us. We met a
        German called Jurgen and two Americans who had moved here
        to work in Poland. All three seemed very at home and
        welcomed in Warsaw.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Walking home I saw the
        parks of the center. I walked for tens of blocks without
        ever feeling like I was in a big city. On the way I
        passed the tomb of the unknown soldier which stands
        guarded by two sentries at all hours. Their eerie
        silhouettes against the eternal flames spooked me and I
        rushed past to make it home to our hotel.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The Warsaw Marriott
        deserves some mention. It is more American than America.
        Prices are quoted in dollars, the outside temperature in
        degrees Fahrenheit, the decor is distinctly American and
        there are even American power outlets in the rooms. The
        breakfast is obscene. It is like the most extravagant
        Sunday brunch served every day. There are three counters
        that are over 25 meters long spread with food including a
        make-to-order omelet and waffle bar. Wait staff greet you
        with a smile and say &quot;sir&quot; and
        &quot;madam&quot;. We are staying here thanks to
        Andy&#146;s mom&#146;s good friend Linda Grunau. She
        kindly offered to arrange a very special rate for us and
        we thank her for our little dose of Americana in the
        East. It is so comfortable that we have barely left its
        walls, having been so busy trying to clean up our
        website, attend to our business and bikes.</font></p>

        <td><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>29 August, Warsaw to
        Radom, 116 km</b></font><p><font size="2" face="Arial">We
        got a late start today due to continuing technical
        problems. Fred had to taxi out to the suburbs to get new
        pedals as I grappled with tires once again. After
        battling rude and dangerous drivers for the first few
        kilometers, we were surprised and relieved to find bike
        path running parallel to our intended route. It was full
        of fellow cyclists, too. Through miles and miles of
        suburban apartment blocks, we followed a pair of
        shirtless young Poles like greyhounds chasing a
        mechanical rabbit. Then a voice beside us said something
        in Polish. It was Jan, our angel du jour. When he learned
        we were Americans, he spoke to us in perfect and
        articulate English as he pedaled alongside us. With his
        ponytail and casual manner, Jan would look right at home
        in Silicon Valley, so it came as no surprise when he told
        us he writes code for a living (&quot;I prefer riding my
        bike,&quot; he added). He also explained the presence of
        the bike path and all the other cyclists, saying that
        everyone was headed to a forest a few kilometers beyond,
        where the bike path would abruptly end, forcing us onto a
        busy highway. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Fortunately, our willing
        and able guide knew of an alternate route. He led us down
        a labyrinth of country lanes, past elegant country homes,
        rolling meadows and dikes holding back the waters of the
        mighty Vistula (a.k.a. Wisla). At one point he asked us
        if we wanted to see an old Polish manor house, and soon
        we were poking around inside an elegant old place which
        was obviously private. Jan said it belonged to an
        organization of writers. He had the good sense to put on
        a tee shirt before entering, but that didn&#146;t keep us
        from getting thrown out by a security dude. &quot;But
        these are important visitors from California,&quot; Jan
        pleaded to no avail, our sweaty cycling gear hardly
        befitting visiting dignitaries. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">After another stop in an
        orchard to steal plums, anarchistic Jan took us to the
        restaurant he always stops at on his bike rides, where we
        had salads and beers. Everyone there knew him, including
        many of the other customers, and they all shook his hand
        while looking at us with bewilderment and curiosity. Then
        we were on the main road again, following Jan at a very
        brisk pace. After 50 kilometers of riding together, we
        parted ways, just outside the town of Warka.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Beyond Warka the traffic
        dwindled to a trickle and we were able to enjoy our
        surroundings. Thick forests were interspersed with little
        villages and scenes of pastoral life: a hunched-over old
        man herding his cars home with a stick; two young girls
        on bicycles with their single cow; another ancient woman
        sitting in front of her hovel plucking a chicken. The
        houses in this area are made of wood and barely
        distinguishable from barns or stables. Most had smoke
        coming out of their chimneys, which given the heat of the
        day were evidently being used for cooking. It almost felt
        like we&#146;d been transported back to the Middle Ages.
        As the hot sun sunk into the horizon, people began to
        abandon their work and sit outside their houses, hoping
        to catch a cooling breeze. Many waved at us and smiled
        &#150;behavior we hadn&#146;t really witnessed since
        Spain. Had we finally crossed to the south of the
        &quot;scowling line&quot;? </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">It was almost totally dark
        by the time we got to the big, nasty, industrial town of
        Radom. The only available lodging we could find was in a
        drab office building doubling as a hotel. Our two-room
        suite had been recently remodeled without using any
        natural materials or fibers; the beds, the shower, the
        carpeting and even the walls were made of plastic. After
        the usual ablutions we dried ourselves on the
        postage-stamp towels and went out in search of dinner,
        the only place still open being a very lively Laotian
        restaurant called &quot;A Million Elephants.&quot;
        Incredibly, the waitress provided us with an English
        version of the menu and brought us edible Asian food. I
        had to pinch myself to assure I wasn&#146;t hallucinating
        the whole thing. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">After dinner, I could
        hardly manage to haul my ass up the three flights of
        stairs to our weird room/office. Forty-year-old
        Jan&#146;s stamina and pace had really done me in.</font></p>

        Krakow, 8.5 K</b></font><p><font size="2" face="Arial">At
        four this morning the forecasted rain began to fall.
        First a trickle and then a drench fell on the streets.
        When we finally awoke at around eight it was pouring,
        which made sleeping another hour seem a better idea than
        rousing. Radom&#146;s grayness was hard to distinguish
        from that of the sky. When we did finally emerge from our
        cocoons we were not encouraged. We decided to get up and
        get some coffee and figure out the day&#146;s game plan.
        Our bikes loaded, donning rain gear, we set out into the
        pouring rain. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The road in front of our
        hotel, like many roads in Poland, had a trench running
        down it just left of the curb and rain gutter formed by
        heavy trucks. This mid-road canyon forms a perfect
        conduit for rain water to gather and race towards lower
        parts. Coincidentally this space corresponds to the place
        that motorists expect bicycles to ride. The drivers
        seemed especially impatient with us as we occupied
        &quot;their&quot; part of the lane in order to avoid
        having to ride through the torrent. They honked, spun
        their tires impatiently and shouted curses at us with
        little empathy for our situation. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">We wandered about town in
        the downpour getting soaked to the bone in search of
        coffee and breakfast. We found no such thing; the only
        recommendation we were able to solicit was
        McDonald&#146;s, which seemed wholly unpalatable. We gave
        up and went off towards the train station. I wondered if
        we should change our name to TrainBrats when we decided
        to take one all the way to Krakow. It seemed like the
        only logical option after hearing that there would be
        rain for the next three days and seeing that the Polish
        drivers take no mind of cyclists rain or shine. On the
        way to the train station I nearly became an adornment of
        a Lada station wagon. The Lada&#146;s driver made a left
        hand turn into me as I raced down a hill to the station.
        I was so furious as I locked my breaks and slid towards
        him I cursed at the top of my lungs. Several other
        pedestrians witnessing his madness joined me in my futile
        ravings. This incident led both Andrew and me to the
        conclusion that the automobile should be deemed illegal
        in Poland and that everyone should be forced to take
        public transportation, walk or ride a bike.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Getting to Krakow was to
        be an ordeal from the start. None of the agents nor the
        information counter spoke English nor were they very
        patient with our few words of Polish (consisting mainly
        of town names) and gesticulation. Seeing the
        ridiculousness of our predicament, a youngster who spoke
        English beautifully volunteered to act as translator.
        Even after this good Samaritan&#146;s effort we managed
        to miss our train. While we waited on the platform a
        notice announcing that the train would be ten minutes
        late was displayed on the quay&#146;s information screen.
        At my suggestion Andy happily went off to find us a
        second coffee and a snack for the train. Just after he
        ordered coffee the train rolled into the station. I ran
        to find Andy and we made it back to the platform just in
        time to watch our train depart without us. Despondently I
        trudged back to the ticket windows to try a second time
        to play charades with the rail staff. Already tired of my
        antics, but understanding (and laughing about) our
        situation the information clerk grimaced and gave me the
        time of the next train. Her facial expression left me
        wondering if she&#146;d lead me to the platform by the
        hand and put me on it herself. Regrettably she sent me
        off to brave the Polish transportation system on my own.
        This time we&#146;d have to change trains two times
        instead of once. Our first train seemed to stop every two
        hundred yards at stations that had more grass than people
        on the platforms. One phenomenon we&#146;ve not been able
        to understand on these small and slow trains is why so
        many people opt to stay in the baggage cars and drink
        profusely. I&#146;m not so worried that they&#146;ll
        steal anything from the bikes as barf on them. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">While I wasn&#146;t
        watching our bikes to make sure that they were not
        mistaken for &quot;in-flight&quot; bags I gazed out the
        window. The terrain seemed to change from gently rolling
        to roller-coaster, from occasional forested patches to
        mostly wooded with some pastures.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Our first transfer put us
        on a more traditional European style train with
        compartments. We sat in a car with an older man who
        looked like my grandpa Jack (long deceased). We were
        eating chocolate cookies and I shared them with him.
        We&#146;d been told to place our bikes in the end of the
        last car near the door since this train had no
        drunk&#146;s baggage area. There they substantially
        blocked entry and exit which would not normally be
        problematic. The train was an enormous and nearly empty.
        Yet everyone wanted to exit and enter at the door near
        our bikes, each time risking that Andy&#146;s bike would
        roll out the door onto them on the platform and crush
        them to death. When I went to the bathroom at the other
        end of the car I got some idea why there was more traffic
        than normal through &quot;our&quot; door. A huge and
        sour-smelling woman was blocking the door to the train
        and the toilet at the other end of the car. She and her
        enormous box made it nearly impossible to get to the
        toilet. I finally slid by her and recall trying to decide
        which smelled worse, her or the lavatory. When my Grandpa
        Jack look-a-like stood up to exit the train I grabbed his
        suitcase and helped him hoist it over our bikes and
        handed it to him on the platform. He slammed the door and
        waved goodbye. When I returned to our compartment I
        noticed he&#146;d left his shopping bag. I grabbed it and
        ran back to the door that was hopelessly stuck. I tugged
        at it and yelled to the old man helplessly through the
        closed door and window. When Andy and I finally wedged
        the door open, the train made a warning signal and
        lurched forward. The bag contained two loaves of bread
        and some vegetables. I couldn&#146;t help but imagine the
        poor old dude&#146;s empty and growling stomach.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">When we finally arrived in
        Krakow we were cursed by the conductors for trying to
        cross the tracks with our bikes. There was, after all, an
        unmarked ramp nearly a kilometer up the platform.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">After exiting transit
        hell, a short ride in the mist through the old town led
        us to our hotel. There we gladly soaked ourselves in a
        hot shower before seeking our first meal of the day. A
        pizza the size of a trash can lid did the trick for me. A
        quick spin around the center confirmed my memory of
        Krakow as one of the great cities of Europe. Great
        examples of architecture from every era of the city
        astounded us at every turn. I was unfathomably impressed
        by how well scaled the old city was for pedestrians and
        relieved by how little traffic there was. The streets
        burble with the voices of people out for wild time on a
        Saturday night instead of ringing with the screaming of
        tires and engines. The center square is among the most
        impressive I&#146;ve ever seen. At 200m x 200m it stands
        as one of the largest and liveliest I&#146;ve been in.
        Arcades and cafés ring the square and the central market
        building that sits in the middle. Crowds of weekenders
        wander about and listen to music, reveling in the
        town&#146;s energy. All this in a heavy mist! Imagine
        what must happen here when the weather is accommodating? </font></p>

        Oswiecim, 67 km</b></font><p><font size="2" face="Arial">The
        sky was appropriately gray as we set off to </font><a href="glauschw.htm" target="contents"><font size="2" face="Arial">Auschwitz</font></a><font size="2" face="Arial"> this morning. Fred and I had
        decided that after a full day of walking around in the
        glowing serenity that constitutes Krakow, we could both
        stand a dose of sobering reality. The desired effect of
        gloominess was quickly dispelled, however. After a brief
        encounter with Krakow&#146;s suburbs, we found ourselves
        surrounded by gorgeous scenery, all crickety-sounding and
        harvest-smelling, with a fuzzy yellow sun poking through
        the clouds above our heads. It felt terrific to be riding
        unburdened for a change, slicing through a ripping
        headwind with relative ease. Many of the houses we passed
        were made of interlocking notched beams, reminding me of
        the Lincoln Logs I played with as a kid. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">At every turn of the
        winding, roller-coaster road, our eyes were greeted with
        more scenes of pastoral life: a man tilling his field
        with a horse-drawn plow; a hunchbacked &quot;apple
        lady&quot; (Fred&#146;s term for an old woman whose face
        resembles a dried apple) shlepping two buckets of milk on
        a yoke across her shoulders; peasants of both sexes
        pulling hand-hewn wooden carts full of hay; a skinny man
        riding his bike while carrying a long-handled scythe (a
        common sight for us over the past few weeks, which
        normally arouses superstitious feelings in me, though
        today it seemed fitting). The people engaged in these
        menial tasks are invariably elderly, making you realize
        that they&#146;re a vanishing breed. Their offspring
        doubtless ride tractors and drive cars, which I realize
        saves them a lot of toil; but bourgeois American that I
        am, I still find the older ways more picturesque.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">After only 2½ hours and
        sixty kilometers of swift pedaling, we had arrived in
        Oswiecim, a small and nondescript town made famous by the
        Nazis&#146; decision to build their largest concentration
        camps here. We first stopped at Birkenau (a.k.a.
        Auschwitz II), which despite having been largely
        destroyed by Germans fleeing the Soviet army, is as
        horrifying and imposing a sight as I&#146;ve ever seen.
        Its vast size attests to the massive scale of the
        operation. Only several rows of buildings remain, framing
        a huge field of foundations and chimneys belonging to
        what was once over 300 separate prison barracks. High
        barbed wire fences, punctuated by watch towers, surround
        the whole complex. Train tracks lead right through the
        center of the camp to the gas chambers and crematoria on
        the far side of the site, where over a million people
        were systematically exterminated. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Fred and I wandered around
        under the drizzle, seeking refuge in barracks buildings
        when the rain got harder. On the walls inside, the German
        slogans in gothic font were chillingly intact, as were
        sketches and paintings made by prisoners. What struck me
        was how recent it all seemed, especially after medieval
        Krakow. All of these buildings were occupied, with trains
        of people arriving to be gassed every day, less than
        twenty years before I was born. It&#146;s enough to make
        one question the very nature of civilization. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Auschwitz I was only a
        couple of kilometers away, but strikingly different in
        scale and feel from the vast and efficient killing
        machine of Birkenau. With it tree-lined streets and tidy
        buildings reminiscent of college dormitories, the older
        camp felt almost like a country village, harboring a
        cottage industry in the shadow of its behemoth,
        assembly-line style neighbor. Inside the buildings,
        though, are literally heaps and heaps of testimony to the
        horrors of the place. One hall housed 43,000 pairs of
        victims&#146; shoes, many of them belonging to murdered
        children, while another contained a virtual mountain of
        human hair, once destined to be shipped back to the Reich
        and made into cloth. Other buildings were devoted to
        accounts of life in the camp, while still more were
        assigned to individual countries&#146; experience of the
        war and its atrocities. We stumbled into the hall of the
        Soviet Union, which suffered a total of 20,000,000 war
        dead. Confronted with such massive tragedy, Fred and I
        felt awash in an overwhelming numbness. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">At five p.m. there was a
        screening of a film documenting the Soviet liberation of
        Auschwitz dubbed in English. After a prolonged
        misunderstanding between Fred and the
        projectionist-ticket-taker, we sat in the dark while
        mosquitoes munched on us and a group of Germans talked
        loudly and behaved as if on a visit to Disneyland.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">While we had intended to
        ride back to Krakow, the sun was already low in the sky
        by now. Polish roads are no place to be riding at dusk,
        so we grudgingly climbed aboard another train, the
        slowest I&#146;ve ever been on. It deposited us in Krakow
        at about the same time that our bikes would have, and the
        short ride from the station to the town center was no fun
        at all. A concert benefiting flood victims in the west of
        Poland was underway on the central square, where we had
        to push our way through throngs of drunken teens. We
        intentionally chose a quiet place for dinner, the
        restaurant of the Hotel Francuski, which features
        mediocre food and appallingly bad service in an elegant
        setting. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Back in our room, the t.v.
        is tuned to the only station broadcasting in English.
        Fred and I have determined that Sky News &#150;the
        UK&#146;s answer to CNN&#151;should be renamed &quot;Di
        News,&quot; since that&#146;s all that they&#146;ve been
        covering, commercial free, since yesterday morning. The
        princess&#146;s death has actually affected me more than
        I&#146;d ever thought it would, probably since it
        happened in Paris and involved a car. An evil car.</font></p>

        figures so infrequently into our trip that it is always
        relaxing when we&#146;re able to make time for it. Krakow
        is for the tourist, so we had to take advantage of the
        moment and visit it. When the kings of Poland left it to
        govern from a more central spot (Warsaw) it ceased to
        grow and change. Luckily from a political standpoint it
        was not worth destroying. It was so unimportant to the
        invading forces that it remains much as it was. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Before departing we spent
        a day touring the Wawel (Vah-vehl). It stands on a stone
        mound by the Vistula lording over the old city. Behind
        its fortifications are a Cathedral, the royal residence,
        the royal treasury, former military buildings and some
        ruins. Legend tells us that a cave below the castle was
        home to a voracious dragon noted for carrying off virgins
        to his cave and eating them. One brave king had a sheep
        stuffed with sulfur, ignited the beast and fed it to the
        dragon who upon finishing his meal found himself a little
        thirsty. Drinking from the river to quench his
        aforementioned thirst the dragon made an evil cocktail in
        his stomach and exploded, thus ridding the community its
        scourge.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The dragon wasn&#146;t the
        only problem the people of Krakow faced over time. When
        the invading force of the Tartars arrived and took over
        the city they shot an arrow through the throat of the
        town crier as he played the song of warning on his horn.
        To this day the tune remains truncated and sounds as it
        did that day marking each hour in the old city. The
        Austrians and Germans had their time in Krakow too, both
        managing to carry off many of the city&#146;s treasures
        during their occupations. Knowing the legacy of theft,
        the Poles sent much of the Castle&#146;s artwork to
        Canada just before the first war. When the Soviets
        demanded its return so they could adorn the Wawel the
        Canadians balked. It was not until the 1970&#146;s that
        it all came back and now sits in the museum there. One of
        the remarkable works that is on display is the &quot;Last
        Judgment&quot; by Bosch, lovely and horrible at the same
        time. The King&#146;s thrown room is worth mention. The
        ceiling is an enormous wood grail accented with gold
        leaf. In each of the center squares there are busts of
        prominent townspeople. Once every indentation in the
        giant waffle was filled in with a head, now only forty
        remain.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Upon arriving at the
        castle we began to look for a guide, but the geeks who
        approached us at the gates of the Wawel made us decide it
        might be better to see it on our own. As we looked out
        upon the river, in earshot of a guide&#146;s presentation
        we realized we wanted to be with this little group. It
        was a man, a woman and their tour leader. The guide was
        stylishly dressed, strikingly tan, articulate, concise
        and interesting. We were reluctant to propose joining the
        three of them thinking that the couple was British. They
        turned out to be from North Carolina and were supervising
        the construction of a Southern Baptist Church in Prague.
        They&#146;d taken a day off from work and had but 24
        hours to see all of Krakow. They graciously invited us to
        join them and we proceeded to &quot;do&quot; the Wawel.
        It was an accelerated tour; we booked through the castle
        and then the cathedral as fast as John and Libba Pruitt
        could walk.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">As Izabella the tour guide
        dragged the Pruitts off to see the other twenty
        attractions in and around Krakow for what remained of the
        day we were left to see the rest of the Wawel on our own.
        We&#146;d noticed a young woman wearing bicycling clothes
        throughout the day as we had visited the site. Finally
        mounting the bell tower of the cathedral we approached
        and met brave Ylva. She&#146;d toured much of Northern
        Europe on her own, getting as far north as the Lofoten
        Islands. Ylva mentioned that her only woe was that she
        had run out of things to read in English and was on the
        prowl for new reading material. Her secret to remaining
        sane was talking to herself. I really admire her
        tenacity, knowing I&#146;d have difficulty doing such a
        voyage by myself. Ylva will ride for another two more
        months before returning to her native Adelaide. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Today&#146;s ride included
        another tourist opportunity, the famous </font><a href="glkrsalt.htm" target="contents"><font size="2" face="Arial">Salt Mine</font></a><font size="2" face="Arial">. It stands as the only mine in the
        UNESCO registry. After having seen it we are not sure why
        it is a tourist destination. The only really cool part of
        the exhibit was a church carved into a cavern of salt.
        Chandeliers, Mary, Jesus, a bas relief of the last supper
        and all the other adornments of the place of worship were
        carved from rock salt. The lighting designer of the
        attraction took advantage of the translucence of the rock
        salt, making Christ&#146;s sacred heart glow. The mine
        employed three miners to create all of the sculpture in
        the Church, paying them only salt miners wages. The
        underground workers apparently had a lot of time on their
        hands because they created 26 other chapels and various
        other sculpture (including more dwarfs than you can
        imagine). We spent nearly two hours bored to death 100
        some odd meters below ground in temperatures hovering
        around 55 degrees Fahrenheit (14 degrees Centigrade). We
        did manage to meet two more cyclists, Monica and Greg.
        They&#146;d been traveling for a few more months than we
        had, but only in Europe. Monica commented that she was
        glad to be going back to the States in a month. She
        thought she&#146;d appreciated about as much as she could
        and the rest would better be left for another trip.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">After a brief lunch in
        town we hit the road again. Leaving the salt mine village
        we mounted a hill that made us climb another 100 meters.
        Climbing would be the theme for the day. Andy had
        cleverly plotted out a route that would keep us off a
        nasty four lane highway. Unfortunately he didn&#146;t
        anticipate how badly the roads were marked and how
        inadequate our maps were to make such a trip. We missed a
        turn and ended up hopelessly in the wrong direction. Not
        being able to correct our navigational error we had to go
        to the big highway anyway. Andy complained continuously
        about the error for the remainder of the day. He was very
        disappointed with our miscalculation which put us some 50
        km out of the way and forced us to climb some 500 meters
        unnecessarily. The big highway turned out to be
        not-so-bad. It wound through a beautiful river valley and
        there was a little road on the other bank that gave us 12
        km of refuge from the whirring cars. My head throbbed
        from lack of food and Andy&#146;s crooning about our
        mistake so I insisted we stop at a roadside motel.
        Slovakia will have to wait for tomorrow.</font></p>
