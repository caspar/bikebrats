        Francisville, LA to Franklinton, 96 miles</b></font><p><font size="2" face="Arial">Now that we&#146;re East of the
        Mississippi, everything looks, sounds, tastes and smells
        of The South, with all of the cliches intact.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Our day off in St.
        Francisville had been a necessity, and went by way<b> </b>too
        fast. Yesterday morning was spent in a futile search for
        brunch. We walked all over the small, Disneyesque town by
        the banks of the Big River, admiring the perfectly
        restored antebellum buildings, the old cemetery, and the
        towering trees. We found three restaurants in town which
        obviously catered to tourists, but all of them were
        mysteriously closed on Sundays, so we ended up at Sonic
        Burgers on the highway outside of town, where Mars raved
        about the lime squishee. The afternoon was devoted to
        laundry and f.t.p.&#146;ing. By the pool a young Southern
        belle was sunning next to a baby alligator in a cooler.
        Her fratboy hubby and his loud pals came by later with
        another tiny gator. Apparently they had found them next
        to their roadkill mom and planned to raise them for a few
        months before releasing them into a bayou, but the way
        they were handling the poor reptiles, I&#146;d be
        surprised if they survived the day. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Gloria, who drove us to
        the ferry two days ago, had told us that St. Francisville
        was in the hilliest part of Louisiana, to which we
        laughed since we hadn&#146;t seen a hill in days. But
        nearly a hundred miles of riding up and down and up and
        down have convinced me that she was well-informed.
        Thankfully, Louisiana&#146;s Hill Country is much tamer
        than its Texan cousin; I didn&#146;t have to use my
        granny gear once all day, perhaps because the tailwind we
        were blessed with fairly blew us up all the hills.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Today&#146;s first stop
        was at Oakley Plantation, where John James Audubon and
        his young male assistant (the guide informed us that they
        shared a bedroom, and we only saw one bed in it) spent a
        few months, making prints and tutoring the owner&#146;s
        daughter. The house, its &quot;dependencies&quot; (like
        the kitchen and the slave quarters) and the grounds were
        in exquisite shape. On the tour with us was a group of
        demonstrative French people who were very impressed with
        our feat; they made a big point of poking at my quads and
        glutes and told me of their plan to rent a motor home in
        Phoenix after touring the South. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">From here the road wound
        through verdant canopied roads, past columned plantation
        homes and tarpaper shacks. The air was heavy and moist,
        carrying the sounds of birds, crickets and frogs. The
        overall impression of Southerness was almost
        overwhelming. In Norwood we stopped for lunch. Fred
        ordered what is likely to be his last chicken fried steak
        for a while: it looked like pounded, breaded placenta. A
        gregarious blond guy at the table next to us expressed
        curiosity over our route and told us how to pronounce the
        names of the towns we were to pass through on the way to
        Franklinton. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">By the time we reached
        Chipola (accent on the second syllable, provoking us to
        dub it &quot;Shithola&quot;), all evidence of Southern
        opulence had disappeared. Most houses were trailers, with
        multiple autos on blocks in their front yards and lots of
        mean barking dogs (&quot;forty acres and a mule
        territory,&quot; my brother noted). But the scenery was
        still gorgeous and the road a dream. At mile seventy-five
        came Tangipahoa (which we&#146;d forgotten how to
        pronounce by the time we reached it), more a ruin than a
        town. Lots of nasty dogs and sullen-looking little black
        kids. The last twenty miles were especially hilly, just
        when we were ready for the cycling day to be over, but
        the gorgeous quality of the light and the perfect rolling
        pastures more than made up for the pain.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Franklinton isn&#146;t
        much to get excited about, but it is probably the biggest
        town we&#146;ve been in since DeRidder. Coming into town,
        our welcoming committee consisted of an asshole in a blue
        Cadillac Sedan de Ville with Louisiana plates WXJ I45,
        who thought it clever to lay into his horn for the
        several minutes he drove behind us. We&#146;re now
        lounging around our fleabag motel, wondering whether we
        should take a mini-break in New Orleans tomorrow&#133;</font></p>

        Franklinton, LA to Gulfport, MS, 96 miles&#151;guest
        rider/writer Mars</b></font><p><font size="2" face="Arial">A day for the olfactory sense. The
        above-mentioned fleabag is good indication that most of
        this part of the country has been soaked in stale, stinky
        backwash for a good, long time. Our motel room was no
        exception. Since our impression of Franklinton was less
        than favorable, we decided to pedal 20 or so miles to
        Bogalusa for breakfast. (A personal profile note of
        interest: Bikebrat Fred has the metabolism of a
        hummingbird and cannot operate effectively without
        frequent ingestion of high-energy foods. Fred also admits
        to being cranky, and even fell while stationary in front
        of a few amused rednecks. &quot;I don&#146;t like riding
        before breakfast,&quot; he explains.) We woke to a thick,
        threatening sky, with wind pushing dark clouds in various
        directions. Since towns are now few and far between, we
        have good reason to be fearful of getting stuck in a
        storm with no shelter.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">While en route to
        Bogalusa, I held my breath several times passing some
        ripe roadkill at various stages of decomposition.
        Everything smells ripe. The air is sweet with honeysuckle
        and cow dung. The ever-present ditchwater smells like
        ditchwater, but worse. Are we in India?</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Bogalusa, a relatively
        thriving metropolis of 14,000, is obviously industrial,
        and centered on what was formally the largest paper mill
        in the country. We tried the first breakfast place into
        town and entered a desolate and again stinky little place
        with nobody in sight but Bob Barker on the blaring TV. It
        smells as if the carpet was flooded and never dealt
        with&#133; mildew to the tenth power. Two ladies emerge
        and say they&#146;re between meals&#151;try &quot;The
        Boxcar.&quot; Their contorted directions, which include
        no street names, but many red lights and train trestles,
        somehow lead us easily to a quintessential diner. The
        Boxcar is a train car with maybe five tables. This is
        truly a family-run operation&#151;two brothers own the
        place and their infirm mother seems to hang out just for
        moral support, or a cheap nursing home. They are
        extremely friendly and genuinely interested in our trip.
        The owners pull all of their customers into the
        conversation (&quot;y&#146;all gotta get a bike and go to
        Florida with these boys!&quot;), and before you know it,
        everyone is either helping us with route planning,
        offering us words of encouragement or just staring at us
        slack-jawed, in utter disbelief. The breakfast is
        huge&#151;two full plates of food each. We all are given
        grits, whether we asked for them or not. The extremely
        tentative waitress (&quot;Y&#146;all done with your
        ice?&quot;) tells us that she doesn&#146;t eat that grits
        crap and is unable to tell us what grits really are. If
        anybody out there knows what they are, tell us! </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">As we leave Bogalusa,
        which we have cruelly and incorrectly dubbed
        &quot;Bogusloser,&quot; there is an anti-climactic
        bridge-crossing into Mississippi. The meteorological
        advice offered at the Boxcar and our own built-in
        barometers (my knee) tell us storms are on the way. Our
        original intention was to go some 40 more miles into the
        heart of nowhere and camp tonight, but A+F are relative
        newbies to the camping phenomenon and opt not to be
        deflowered in such nasty conditions. Our travel advisor
        at the Boxcar said that there aren&#146;t any hotels near
        where we were headed (Wiggins). A decision needed to be
        made quickly. At the first town in Mississippi,
        appropriately called Crossroads, we decided to turn south
        toward the coast for protection from the storm, despite
        paying the price with a raging wind out of the southwest.
        (Side note for Blues fans&#151;I believe that this is the
        &quot;Crossroads&quot; that legend Robert Johnson sang
        about. Since my historical point was lost on the brats
        [&quot;who&#146;s Robert Johnson?&quot;], I thought
        I&#146;d throw it into cyberspace).</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The scenery is still lush,
        stunning, and stinky as the miles into the wind get
        tougher. We trade off miles breaking the wind and watch
        the odometer carefully. The brutal humidity drenches us
        and fluid intake is at IV level. Our next country store
        stop doubled as a butcher shop, where we quaffed
        Gatorades &#145;n stuff and received still more
        directions. The garbage from the butcher was stacked in
        flimsy boxes by our bikes, and we offered various
        theories on what was the source of the worst smell of the
        day. Not pretty&#133; Cleanliness is not a big priority
        down here.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Our minds become focused
        on getting to the coast before the storms do. The promise
        of many beaches and casinos in Gulfport seems to motivate
        us a bit and takes the edge off of our nerves and tired
        legs. En route, though, we stopped through butt-ugly
        Picayune and Kiln, the hometown of Green Bay Packer great
        Brett Favre. Even Andy, ambivalent to professional
        sports, feels his Wisconsin roots emerge and remarks on
        the spiritual nature of our Packer pilgrimage.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The final miles into
        Gulfport were very easy and light-hearted. We gleefully
        pedaled along the ocean toward the tall Grand Casino,
        arguably the best hotel in Mississippi. The last smell of
        the day is that of ourselves, which must not impress the
        bellboys in front of the hotel. We are coated in sweat,
        sunscreen, road detritus and fatigue. After another 90+
        mile day, we relished the luxury of our room, tasty
        dinner, blackjack tables and clean shower. </font></p>

        <td><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>April 24, Gulfport, MS
        to Dauphin Island, AL</b></font><p><font size="2" face="Arial">Our Gulfport R&amp;R felt justified as we
        watched the Weather Channel documenting the severe
        thunder showers and tornado warnings that were pummeling
        our intended route. Gambling was obviously not the right
        distraction for me. My cash card demonstrated its
        unwillingness to be party to this type of debauchery. It
        seemed to be incompatible with all the machines in the
        casino. Proving my ATM card correct I lost a
        &quot;Ben&quot;, Marty dropped the same. Andy was our
        sole winner walking with over a hundred smackers. The
        experience reminded me of the taxi driver I had a few
        years ago in Las Vegas. She asked, &quot;Are you a
        gambler?&quot; When I said no she said &quot;Good! Look
        around you; this place was not built on winners.&quot;
        Most of the folks in the Gulfport casino were retirees
        hypnotized by the flashing lights and deafening noise of
        the slots. The din and distraction of these vile machines
        give me the shivers.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Took the opportunity of
        our downtime to hit the local bike shop. Rode there on
        Seigfried (my bike) without my packs. Odd to ride the
        beast unburdened. Felt clumsy and unstable pedaling
        without sixty pounds of gear. I wonder if I&#146;ll ever
        be able to appreciate riding this way again? Gulfport
        drivers menaced me en route to the shop by driving too
        close, cutting into my path and not yielding
        right-of-way. When I finally arrived at the local Schwinn
        depot I was greeted by a most unknowledgeable shopkeep.
        He pacified his ignorance listening to a Christian radio
        station and told me he had found this vocation recently.
        He had taken over the shop from his lessee a few months
        earlier and had no experience bicycling or running a
        shop. After giving him a few tips on what products he
        might consider carrying I rode off with what I could find
        from my shopping list.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">On the way back to
        blue-haired zombie land I had cause to declare butthead
        driver of the week. This car drove off an empty road onto
        the shoulder directly next to me and began to try to push
        me off the road knowingly and then sped off. Foolishly, I
        sprinted to catch him at the next light. I was so furious
        I could scarcely breathe. I rapped on his passenger
        window and the driver&#146;s mother rolled down the
        window. Two deep breaths and I reeled on him &quot;What
        were you thinking? Would you have driven that close if I
        were your son, daughter, brother or friend?&quot;
        &quot;You did come awfully close honey,&quot; added his
        mother. I capped it off eloquently with &quot;You are a
        loser!&quot; which made me feel better especially since
        he didn&#146;t &quot;cap&quot; me with a gun or run me
        over after I rode away.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">I changed our chains,
        cleaned our drivetrains and then spent the rest of the
        afternoon cleaning the grease from under my nails. We had
        a big evening planned and I intended to look my best. The
        woman who answered the phone at Joey&#146;s, the club we
        were to go to, told me that we were only five miles away.
        After 12 miles and an $18 cab fare we arrived. Luck was
        with us. Wednesdays are &quot;drink and drown
        night.&quot; D&amp;D means that you pay admission, are
        given a cup and can drink as much as you can until
        midnight for free. Nothing could appeal to Andy&#146;s
        parsimonious side more. I had a few beers while Andrew
        tried to satisfy the second &quot;D&quot;. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">We played pool with some
        sharks and lost badly while a lawyer from USX tried to
        pick up on Andy. Mingling was fun. We met a gargantuan
        drag named Simone who stood 6&#146;5&quot; barefoot and
        was the same height as the Eiffel Tower in heels and her
        wig. I had visions of a cartoonish end for her if she
        were to get too close to the overhead fans. Everyone
        seemed sort of drunk or stoned and the music blared so
        loudly that I too began to feel dizzy. I left Andy there
        to pursue D&amp;D to its fullest and retired to our
        hotel. On the way back the talkative driver told me of
        all the benefits the Casinos were bringing to the
        community.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The morning came too soon
        for all of us, especially Andrew. Our trip began on a
        busy coastal four-lane number without a shoulder.
        Andy&#146;s new chain was giving his derailleur heartburn
        and his bike would not stay in gear. Mechanical problems,
        hangover, and riding conditions all taken together marred
        poor Andy&#146;s riding experience. After a few stops and
        tense moments his bike was finally functioning.
        Mechanical failure would be one of this day&#146;s
        themes. The sky was dark and threatening, traffic
        obnoxious and the roads were poorly surfaced. Mars saved
        the day by navigating us onto quieter roads and by lunch
        the sky began to clear. An unexpected diversion came in
        the form of a big dead bear by the side of the road,
        which bore an uncanny resemblance to a rug after being
        picked clean by buzzards.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Lunch was a revelation. It
        was on this leg we discovered the ultimate fast food
        lunch, Wendy&#146;s Pita Pocket; tasty, caloric and
        healthy all packaged together. Difficult to order in the
        deep south without a laugh. Seems their accents make
        &quot;Pita&quot; sound like &quot;Peter&quot;, and when
        our hostess barked our order of &quot;Peters&quot; to the
        kitchen everyone in the queue had a chuckle.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Quieter roads, sunny
        weather and favorable riding conditions made the
        afternoon more palatable than the morning. We stopped to
        snack at convenience stores in small towns where Mars
        experimented with new incarnations of his favorite junk
        food flavor &quot;Blue raspberry.&quot; We contemplated
        where in nature the elusive blue raspberry occurs while
        Mars tried it in &quot;Now and Laters&quot;, taffy, gum,
        Gatorade and countless other forms.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">As we approached the coast
        the wind became stronger and Andrew&#146;s rear tire
        began to fail. It was a slow leak so we would stop every
        few miles to refill it. Finally as sunset began to
        approach we decided it was time to change it. Readers who
        have traveled or lived in areas plagued by insects know
        that just before sunset is prime feeding time.
        &quot;Nit-Nits&quot; or noseeums descended on us as soon
        as we stopped. I stopped working with Andrew to replace
        the tire to pull out our bug repellent but it was too
        late. We had already been chewed to bits by the little
        buggers. Mars opted to pedal on rather than be eaten
        alive. Unfortunately the changed tire failed once again
        after only a few miles and we had to change it again
        receiving the tidings of the little nasty gnats again
        through our industrial strength &quot;Deet&quot;.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">All day we had had visions
        of camping on a deserted beach on Dauphin Island. We
        imagined a peaceful beach and idyllic sunset sipping
        cocktails as we watched a full moon rise over the
        Atlantic. The second tire change altered that vision.
        Andy and I envisioned our entire bodies covered with
        insect bites and convinced Marty that we should seek a
        Motel. We did watch the sunset over the Atlantic, and
        Andy and Mars did manage to find a margarita, so some of
        the fantasy was realized. As a bonus our other vision
        came to life as welts rose on my legs, arms, neck and
        scalp all courtesy of my friends the nit-nits.</font></p>

        <td><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>April 25, Dauphin
        Island, AL to Pensacola, FL, 60 miles</b></font><p><font size="2" face="Arial">I wanted to cry when I went out to
        pack my bike after a night of near-comatose slumber. The
        rear tire was flat again &#150;the third one in fewer
        than ten miles of riding. Mars and Fred insisted on just
        pumping it up so as to make the ferry to the Alabama
        mainland, where they planned to have breakfast. A fresh
        tube and coffee would have to wait. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">We had anticipated a
        leisurely 50-mile ride along pristine beaches all the way
        to Pensacola, but as soon as we hit the road it became
        evident that we would be riding straight against a
        serious easterly wind. Waves washed over the deck of the
        ferry as we pouted and stood slantways into the gale.
        Fred pumped up my tire during the crossing, but it was
        flat again when we reached the other side, where I pushed
        my bike into the lee side of a closed restaurant for yet
        another round of repairs. I was beginning to feel like
        Sisyphus, and imagined running over my ungrateful mount
        with a steamroller.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Coffee and food at a
        nearby restaurant helped change my mood some. It was in a
        yachty sort of place, with all the other customers
        talking about fish. One old guy came up to us and
        questioned us about our trip, and told us he was a
        cycling enthusiast too. With geeky joy he told us all
        about his three bikes and the componentry he had equipped
        them with himself. He said he&#146;d have to sell all of
        them now though, since a car accident had permanently
        damaged two of his vertebrae. Then our waiter told us
        that his mom&#146;s boyfriend had spent over a year
        riding his bike through Latin America, subsisting
        entirely on nuts and fruit he found by the roadside. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">By the time we had
        finished our meal, it was nearly noon and we&#146;d
        ridden all of four miles. There were over fifty miles of
        slow riding to go. We resorted to the &quot;kilometer
        system&quot;, switching off windbreaking duty with every
        kilometer post. Yes, Alabama surprised us with its
        unlikely embracing of the metric system, plus the best
        roads (and paths!) for cycling we&#146;ve seen in any
        state. Still, every kilometer seemed like ten. In order
        to keep my momentum, I told myself that if I stopped
        pedaling for so much as a second, we&#146;d be blown back
        to Texas. After passing through the town of Gulf Shores,
        we pedaled along the sea coast, which is revoltingly
        overdeveloped. For several miles we rode with an older
        cyclist with an odd riding style that reminded me of a
        frog. We didn&#146;t get a chance to talk to him, though,
        since conversation was futile with the howling wind. He
        turned around at the Florida border, for reasons which
        would become apparent to us later. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">We decided to stop at the
        Flora-bama Lounge and Package Store to grab some grub and
        check out the scene. Preparations were being made for the
        biggest event of the year in these parts: The Annual
        Mullet Toss. It was scheduled to take place the next
        morning, and apparently involves flinging fish for fun
        and profit. When we queried the bartendress exactly where
        the event took place, she told us that the fish were
        thrown &quot;from Florida to Alabama.&quot; We learned
        that the guy who usually wins practices all year in
        earnest, and that many thousands of people attend. If
        Disneyland is the happiest place on Earth, the Florabama
        is probably the straightest place on Earth; even Mars
        felt uncomfortable there. The only decorations were beer
        advertisements, and the clientele tended towards drunken
        frat boys in baseball caps and big-haired bimbos encased
        in tube tops, trapped in an eternal Spring Break. I
        can&#146;t remember ever feeling more like an alien. Our
        cycling gear was obviously not acceptable attire, and no
        one so much as smiled at us. So much for Southern
        hospitality.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The prospect of biking the
        remaining twenty-five miles into Pensacola was not very
        attractive, especially with the knowledge that we&#146;d
        be sharing the shoulderless road with returning clientele
        from the Flora-bama. We made it somehow, though, rolling
        into town just in front of the first in a series of
        thunderstorms that would keep us off the road for the
        duration of the weekend.</font></p>

        Crestview, FL, 62 miles</b></font><p><font size="2" face="Arial">We thought about building an ark it rained
        so hard and long. Instead we broke down and rented a car,
        the first of the trip. We were suckered by Enterprise
        Rent-a-Car who advertised a rate of $14.95 per day that
        somehow worked out to be $27 after all the fine print. We
        felt fleeced for about two seconds until we recalled how
        big Pensacola is and how few, far between and expensive
        taxis were.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">It was a typical BikeBrats
        weekend. We worked on bikes, saw some movies, explored
        nightlife and generally relaxed. My relaxation was
        mandatory. I caught a nasty cold. In the movie department
        we were three-for-three. They were all terrible. Kolya
        was an overly sentimental child exploitation movie. We
        all imagined the Academy members saying &quot;oh, the kid
        is so cute; we have to give it some sort of an award.
        Gross Pointless Blank and the Saint were so bad they
        don&#146;t even deserve comment.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Mars&#146;s departure was
        a blur; I vaguely remember saying adios before dawn on
        Saturday. We will miss his wit, writing, stamina and
        terminally great attitude. He is officially welcome to
        join the Brats anytime. Another Brat encounter, albeit
        short, began just as this one wound down. Our dear and
        wild friend Susan N. joined us for a wacky night on the
        town. She was escaping a difficult domestic situation: a
        mother-in-law visit (her girlfriend&#146;s mother).</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">I was designated driver
        and we did the Pensacola Bar crawl. We decided on a
        lesbian focus partly in honor of our guest and also for a
        little variety. The Red Carpet was a very entertaining
        mix of folks. Everyone from the hot bartendress who
        looked like a southern sorority babe to the drag queens
        seemed to be mixing and having a great time. From the
        carpet we moved on to underclothes. The Red Garter was
        our next stop. It adjoined a &quot;titty&quot; bar so the
        local military boys can go out to a gay bar and still
        remain in the closet. All they need do is enter the
        through the stripper venue and use the hallway that
        connects the two to walk into the queer bar. The jewel in
        the Pensacola homo bar crown (Andrew maintains that it is
        &quot;the&quot; best homo bar in the world &#150; perhaps
        influenced by the Bartendress giving him free beverages
        all night) is indisputably the </font><a href="http://www.cheney.net/gaypocla" target="contents"><font size="2" face="Arial">Riviera</font></a><font size="2" face="Arial">. The live band was doing an Indigo Girls
        cover as we walked in. Still, uncharacteristically, Andy
        raved about them despite his rabid dislike for the
        I-girls. The lead had a great voice and the crowd was so
        inspired they helped them break down their equipment and
        schlep it out to their truck. While we swayed to the
        rhythms of the band we met the most unusual couple I have
        ever met. Amy, a rather nondescript 24 year old white
        girl, works for the FBI and Allen, a very tall, handsome
        and distinctive African American is in the Marine Corps.
        The two live in West Virginia and decided to visit their
        families. Amy was spending time with her aunt, the
        Bartendress of the Riviera and Andrew&#146;s benefactor,
        when we met them. Turns out that Amy had a revelation
        after they married, she liked girls as well as boys.
        Allen encouraged and supported her wishes and now she
        swings both ways. On this night Amy was trying to
        cultivate Allen&#146;s potential switch hitting by
        playing matchmaker between Andy and Allen. Very little
        came of her brokering, although Andy did manage to
        deliver Allen&#146;s first boy-kiss before the night
        ended.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">While all this drama was
        going on, Susan and I managed to meet everyone in the bar
        who was demented by too much alcohol consumed. From the
        clueless dyke who misinterpreted my hello as a pick-up
        line, Rob who jiggled on the dance floor staring at
        himself in the mirror to Justin who announced that he was
        asexual for the last 2.5 years except for numerous
        one-night stands -- we met them all. Rick (the
        manager/owner?) was the victim of Susan&#146;s BikeBrats
        sales pitch. She put her PR hat on and wouldn&#146;t take
        it off until he agreed to take our picture, put it on his
        website, and link to ours. (Rick &#150; wherever you are,
        send us your web and e-mail addresses, they got lost in
        the blur that was Saturday/Sunday)</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">My coach turned into a
        pumpkin as my antihistamines wore off and I staggered off
        to the hotel. I vaguely remember Susan and Andrew
        staggering in around 5am raving about the ultimate
        afterhours bar, Bedlam. Someone from the Riviera drove
        (an extra scary thought) them there though it was two
        blocks away. On the way there Rob the gyrator magically
        produced two six-packs, stuffed a few in Andrew&#146;s
        pockets and explained that Bedlam permitted you to bring
        your own alcohol though they served none. They staggered
        into the bar to find the &quot;Mecca&quot; of Pensacola
        debauchery. Everyone from every bar, straight or gay,
        made their pilgrimage here to complete their weekend if
        they hadn&#146;t had enough intemperance already.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Storms raged Sunday both
        in the sky and the poor heads of my companions. Somehow
        we managed to make it to breakfast at our new trip
        favorite (Waffle House) before 1pm. There we discovered a
        land stuck in time. Where Kraft pasteurized processed
        &quot;Cheese Food&quot; is still worshipped like the
        Oracle of Delphi. Andrew is a fan of the hash browns
        which can be ordered scattered, diced, chunked, diced,
        smothered and/or covered. The most entertaining part of
        the whole experience is listening to the waitresses pass
        the orders to the cooks who have refused to adopt the
        idea of being handed the orders on paper or
        electronically. The question we kept asking is how did
        they keep my smothered/covered/diced order from being
        confused with Andy&#146;s &quot;all of the above&quot;
        order?</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Bike riding? You&#146;ve
        come to this site to read about riding? Pfffft! O.K.,
        after computing until all hours Sunday night we returned
        the car, had another Waffle House experience, checked out
        of the hotel and set out. Andrew had another flat and had
        to change it just before we left. We hadn&#146;t even
        left the city limits when he had another and was nearly
        in tears. A stop at the best bicycle shop of the trip
        remedied everything. The Bike Doctor, run by Mary and her
        husband, sold us a new tire and a few accessories. They
        even extended us the 10% discount reserved for bicycle
        tourists despite my perturbed demeanor. We finally hit
        the road just before two as I was losing my energy, my
        cold and the decongestants getting the best of me.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The only saving graces of
        the day were the weather and the wind. The black, nasty,
        pregnant and threatening clouds hovered around us leaving
        a patch of blue above us almost the entire (short) riding
        day while a stiff wind pushed our butts along at great
        speed. We arrived in Crestview after less than four hours
        of pedaling, checked into the unaffiliated Hilton Motel
        and called it a day.</font></p>
