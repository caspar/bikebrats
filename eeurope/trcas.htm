        Poland to Dolny Kubin, Slovakia, 109 km</b></font><p><font size="2" face="Arial">It was easier getting out of Poland
        than into it. Today&#146;s border protocol was downright
        casual compared to our entrance from Lithuania. We were
        waved through on both sides. The Slovakian passport
        control dude was a rotund Santa-esque old dude and was
        visibly drunk. I wonder if he even noticed us.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Getting to the border was
        the hard part, since it involved traversing the Tatra
        mountain range. This morning I decided we&#146;d avoid
        the truck-filled highway and take side roads. My map
        showed that this would only add ten kilometers of
        distance; what it didn&#146;t show was that my diversion
        also entailed over 600 meters of additional climbing.
        After a coffee-free breakfast (the pre-menstrual waitress
        brought us tea and refused to deal with us any further)
        and squeezing our bikes back out of the
        raccoon-piss-smelling shed where they&#146;d spent the
        night, we began our day on blissfully tranquil roads,
        ascending gently through verdant valleys. We witnessed
        the usual interactions between peasants and livestock,
        and noticed a significant increase in roadside chapels
        and shrines, many of them elaborately carved wooded
        structures with a mountain chalet sensibility. Some
        housed statues that were garishly painted and looked like
        they were made of marzipan, yet what astonished us most
        was Jesus&#146; posture in these. Never have I seen so
        many representations of the Son of God on all fours,
        lying down, or propped up an elbow like a reclining
        Buddha. Another striking feature of these valleys was the
        density of the population. Most of the villages ran into
        one another, a seemingly endless string of four-story
        dwellings. Ubiquitous schoolchildren made no effort to
        disguise the fact that they found us hilarious, and squat
        old peasants walking down the middle of the road and bent
        over under heavy vegetal burdens were a constant hazard.
        Despite all the activity, there were virtually zero cars,
        making for near-perfect riding conditions.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The only thing that kept
        today from being totally perfect was passing from one
        valley to the next. This we had to do five or six times,
        and each time involved coronary-inducing climbs. The
        worst of these took us up to an elevation of nearly a
        thousand meters and was like pedaling up the side of a
        wall.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Back at the border, 62
        kilometers and three gallons of sweat since this
        morning&#146;s start, I began to think about the country
        we were entering. What distinguishes Slovakia as a
        nation? I once spent an uninteresting day in dreary
        Bratislava, an accidental capital if there ever was one.
        Other than that touristic mistake, all I know about this
        land is that it is or was considered by many Czechs as a
        poor relative, a polluted, industrial wasteland. On the
        map it looks brutally mountainous, which could make the
        300 and some kilometers from here to Budapest very long.
        Riding across the invisible line that divides Poland and
        Slovakia, I also began to reminisce a little about
        Poland, a country I wish we&#146;d had more time to
        explore. I&#146;d miss its vitality and quirky people,
        but I definitely wouldn&#146;t miss Poland&#146;s
        drivers, which must rank among the world&#146;s very
        worst.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">I was thinking these
        thoughts and pedaling along the interminable line of
        trucks waiting to get into Poland when my tire exploded.
        Fred says it sounded like a toy gun or a champagne cork
        this time, while it reminded me of a burst balloon.
        Whatever the case, it was a big drag to replace. I had
        rotated my two tires in Warsaw, and getting the
        Helsinki-purchased Nokia tire (they don&#146;t just make
        cell phones anymore) on my rear wheel was an opera in
        five acts. Getting it off was no easier; even using a
        knife and wire-cutters, the whole process took the better
        part of the hour. On the positive side, we provided
        entertainment to a number of bored truck drivers. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">A new tire in place and
        rolling down the road, I was able to drink in my first
        impressions of Slovakia. It actually looked distinctly
        different from anything we&#146;d seen in Poland. The
        landscape looked more rugged and pristine, full of tall
        pines clinging onto the steep slopes, yet at the same
        time it felt more urban and industrialized. Even the
        smaller villages had high-rise apartment blocks on their
        fringes, but most of the housing was rustic wooden
        structures resembling barns, different from those of
        Poland by their close-set proximity to one another and
        their orientation vis-a-vis the street. The main door of
        these houses is always on the long side of the dwelling
        and perpendicular to the street. Some looked very old, in
        stark contrast to the apartment blocks and factories that
        loomed behind them. Catholicism is still very apparent
        here. Elaborately domed churches and lurid roadside
        shrines abound. As for the roads, they&#146;re much
        better here than in Poland, and upon them are far more
        cyclists, many of them sporting helmets and lycra. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">We were exhausted and
        starving when we rolled up to yet another communist-style
        hotel in Dolny Kubin, a monumentally unattractive hole of
        a town. We rushed to dinner. To distract our brains from
        our gnawing appetites, we played backgammon as we waited
        for the food to come. I was ahead in the game and bearing
        off when Fred&#146;s appetizer arrived, a delicious crepe
        stuffed with barbecued pork. I was so hungry that I
        agreed to his ridiculous demand of placing a man back on
        the board for every bite. It was well worth it; I still
        won the game and feel satisfied knowing that Fred has
        screwed up his backgammon karma for months to come.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Though it&#146;s only nine
        thirty now, I&#146;m dog-tired and aching big-time.
        Hopefully tomorrow&#146;s ride will be all downhill&#133;</font></p>

        <td><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>5 September, Dolny
        Kubin to Sturovo, 105 km</b></font><p><font size="2" face="Arial">I had great expectations for breakfast after
        dinner the night before. I was more than disappointed
        when I saw an enormous buffet filled with food that
        looked inedible. The weirdest item on the buffet was a
        little tin full of sausage spread. If I hadn&#146;t been
        awake I might have mistaken it for a container of plum
        jam. Thank goodness I had the wherewithal to avoid it.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The day before we&#146;d
        passed through an enormous river valley and today
        we&#146;d continue along it towards a town called Martin
        some 45km down the canyon. The valley became a gorge and
        we were close enough to the river to hear it roar like a
        caged lion just below the roadbed. Soon we joined a
        busier road with a wide shoulder and the valley opened up
        once again revealing the fields of grains.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">At the outset of this day
        we&#146;d decided that this would be a mixed mode travel
        day. I was keen on being in Budapest on Saturday so we
        could go out and have some fun on a weekend. Andy and I
        agreed to cheat a little on this day in order to make it
        a reality. In Martin we arranged our train travel and set
        out to have some lunch while we waited. A walk down
        Martin&#146;s main pedestrian street revealed little of
        interest for lunch. We eventually settled on a
        substandard hamburger and fries. Downing our lunch we
        watch people ogle our cycles as though they were space
        vehicles.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The train would prove to
        be more interesting than lunch. First was the drama of
        getting our bikes on the train. When we went to the
        baggage office they demanded that we remove our bags and
        leave the bikes with the baggage handlers. Not satisfied
        with this idea I enlisted the support of an English
        speaking passenger to translate for us. It turned out
        that we would have to pay another fifty cents or so to
        have the panniers travel with our cycles. We gladly paid
        and helped the two aging women put the bikes on the train
        to the amusement of all on the platform.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">On the train the only
        drama was the countryside. All of which would have been
        great riding which made both Andy and me a little sad
        that we hadn&#146;t relied on pedal power. Transferring
        the bikes to the second train proved to be as weird as
        mounting them on the first. After providing amusement to
        yet another crowd of passengers we found a compartment
        near the baggage car and settled in to read and write. We
        met our compartment mate, a young engineer off to do his
        military service in Bratislava. He was very opinionated
        about Hungary. He said that it held little interest for
        him and that the whole country had &quot;maybe one town
        of interest and that is Budapest.&quot; His main reason
        for preferring his native Slovakia was its proximity to
        Austria. We left the train at our destination as he was
        getting warmed up to dish on the rest of Eastern Europe.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">From Levice we still had
        an aggressive travel day ahead of us. We&#146;d planned
        to do another 80km to the border and hoped to spend the
        night in Hungary. That would make the day 125km on bike
        and 150km on a slow train. Leaving Levice (the ugliest
        burg in since the border of Poland and Lithuania) was
        relatively painless. Within a few moments we were on the
        edge of a large and lovely valley weaving our way along.
        Every few kilometers we&#146;d ascend the wall of the
        valley 30 or 40 meters and then roll down to the its
        floor. Often we&#146;d race through little villages where
        locals watched us pass with a mixture of curiosity and
        horror. Dogs barked at us, children fled to the side of
        the road and their parents glared. As the sun began to
        approach the horizon we had entered a grape growing
        region. We looked across the vineyards to the Danube
        Valley to Hungary, our ultimate destination for the day.
        A massive baroque church stood on the Hungarian side that
        served as a landmark guiding us to the border. (the
        largest church in Hungary, this town had once been the
        capital of the nation)</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Finding the ferry was a
        little more challenging than we anticipated. Finally a
        family on bikes was enlisted to escort us dockside. On
        the way the Father shook his head and looked at his
        watch. Sure enough, the last ferry had left some time
        before our arrival. Admitting defeat we set out to find a
        place to stay. We came upon a series of signs advertising
        the Motel Non-Stop and followed them up a side street and
        down an alley. Soon we came upon an unlikely gate marked
        with the name of the establishment. We buzzed and were
        about to give up when the manager came out to find us.
        Looking at us sort of confused he told us he had a room
        in a mixture of German, Slovakian, Hungarian and a little
        English thrown in for good measure. He talked to us
        constantly in this language cocktail while escorting us
        through what appeared to be a foundry to an unlikely
        entry to a hotel. He reeked of alcohol. Staggering a
        little he helped us hoist the bikes up the back stairs
        into the hotel. All three of us had cause to laugh when
        he pointed out that the front entrance to the hotel was
        on the mains street. Both Andy and I had failed to see it
        when we drove by.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Against our host&#146;s
        recommendation we decided to go to the much advertised
        Casablanca Restaurant for dinner. We began to order
        sitting on the terrace, but quickly decided to go indoors
        after finding that we were more a meal for the
        mosquitoes. Once inside we began to order food with
        fervor. Two big beers, mineral water, salads, a main
        course and dumplings (even though our waitress scoffed at
        the idea of three main courses for two people.) Just to
        prove our massive appetites Andy ordered another helping
        of dumplings which we ate with great enthusiasm.
        Somewhere along the way we&#146;d ordered a second half
        liter of beer each and both of us were feeling a little
        drunk. We knew that we had very limited Slovakian
        currency left and that we were pushing the limit of our
        finances. Any time we hit a border it is always a fun
        game to try to spend every last local agouti (bit of
        local currency). It is reminiscent of the game show
        &quot;The Price is Right,&quot; where a contestant must
        buy a goods up to, but not exceeding their budget not
        knowing the exact price. We knew that we were close to
        the end of our cash, even so we ordered dessert with
        abandonment. When the check came we laughed upon finding
        how close we were to our limit, we had but 19 agoutis
        left on a 548 agouti bill. We ordered two mineral waters
        to go and bargained the owner down to exactly our
        remaining agoutiage. Walking back to town and our hotel
        we staggered like the manager of our hotel proud of
        having spent every bit of our currency.</font></p>

        Sturovo/Estergom to Budapest, 81 km</b></font><p><font size="2" face="Arial">Another day, another country. One
        of the most incredible features of Europe is its compact
        size, especially appreciable after biking 1100 miles
        across Texas. Sometimes I wonder if Europe was actually
        created for American tourists like me; it really does
        feel like Disneyland sometimes. Today we passed from
        Slovakialand to Hungaryland. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Sleepy Sturovo is the most
        relaxed border crossing we&#146;ve seen in a long time.
        Immigration and customs officials from both Hungary and
        Slovakia share a dilapidated tin building and wander
        around casually among people wishing to cross or joke
        with the waitress in the nearby café. We practically had
        to wave our passports in front of the guards&#146; faces
        to get them to take notice of us and motion us through.
        Still, it took us much longer to get to Hungary proper
        than we had thought. Estergom and its enormous basilica
        (purportedly the fourth largest church in the world) loom
        over Slovakian Sturovo from across the Danube and look
        close enough to reach out and touch. Once upon a time a
        &quot;Friendship Bridge&quot; linked the two towns, but
        all that remains are pylons sticking out of the rushing
        brown water. The only way across now is by ferry. The
        operator of the small boat which plies the river
        seemingly constantly refused to let us take our heavy
        bikes on board, forcing us to wait an additional hour for
        the bigger car ferry. We whiled away the time playing
        backgammon under the disapproving glares of the
        immigration officials and made a spectacle of ourselves
        by smearing sunscreen onto one another&#146;s backs; the
        weather was good enough to ride bareback, we decided, and
        we didn&#146;t have to impress anyone anymore now that we
        had already made it through immigration and customs. The
        bigger boat was really just a barge, pushed rather
        delicately through the raging brown waters by a tugboat
        and a tightly organized crew. Fred and I watched in
        wonderment as three strong men &#150;one looking
        astonishing like Obelix of &quot;Asterix&quot;
        fame&#151;manipulated the mooring cables.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">When we finally made it
        across, we were greeted with a heartening sight: a bike
        path running right along the Danube, toward Budapest.
        &quot;Could it go all the way into town?&quot; we
        wondered giddily as we pumped against the wind, riding
        right alongside the majestic waterway far from any signs
        of motorized traffic. Alas, after ten or fifteen blissful
        kilometers, our path dumped us onto the highway. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The road led us around
        what is known as the &quot;Danube Bend,&quot; a favorite
        weekend getaway spot for Budapestians and a place rich in
        history and natural beauty. We passed through ancient
        villages under dramatically steep, castle-topped hills.
        In a little town called Visegrad we stopped for an early
        lunch at a snack bar type place by the side of the river.
        We thought we would eat outside, but when we went in to
        order, we got caught up in the hype of Princess
        Diana&#146;s funeral, being broadcast live with extensive
        commentary in Hungarian. Unaware that we&#146;d be
        subjected to endless replays of the event on CNN, we
        munched on delicious sandwiches brought to us by the
        place&#146;s friendly owner, alternately transfixed by
        all the royal pomp and admiring the hat collection that
        covered every inch of the place&#146;s walls. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Our bellies full, we
        waddled outside to find a yuppyesque family admiring our
        bikes. The young couple explained in impeccable English
        that they were cycling enthusiasts from nearby Szententre
        and that they admired our machines. Even their
        two-year-old daughter &#150;an avid cyclist
        herself&#151;seemed enthralled. They insisted on giving
        us a map of the region with a recommended route, causing
        Fred and me to remark upon the friendliness of
        Hungarians. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">In less than a minute
        after leaving this generous family, we met up with a trio
        of friendly Hungarian cyclists heading in our direction.
        Victor, Attila and Josef have been friends since
        kindergarten and take day trips from Budapest at every
        opportunity. Victor was the most proficient in English of
        the three and did most of the talking. Pedaling
        lackadaisically alongside us in the busy road, he
        explained that he was studying to be a lawyer, while cute
        young Attila was learning to repair electronic devices.
        We never learned much at all about Victor, who seemed
        painfully shy. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The three of them provided
        a wind block and guide service all the way into town. We
        stopped a number of times &#150;once in a little village
        where they knew of a cheap ice cream place up a cobbled
        street; a couple of times for water to quench our thirst
        and pour over our sweaty bods; and finally at a café on
        Elizabeth island for a farewell beer, where they gave us
        the names of some bike shops and told us to meet them
        again on Monday. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Our pre-outing goal for
        the evening was to put our numerous pages on Poland up on
        the Web. Finding a hotel that would accommodate this task
        wasn&#146;t as easy as it should have been, and we ended
        up in the ultra-glam Kempinski, lured by their weekend
        rate and reliable phone connection. I went out in search
        of supplies &#150;a bag full of whoppers and more liquids
        than you can shake a stick at&#151;while Fred set it up.
        Like many aspects of this trip, we have found a routine
        that works for us.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">It was just around
        midnight when we had finished all the HTML and headed out
        to Budapest&#146;s premier homo club, the Angel. The
        attitude was so thick you could cut it with a knife. Only
        two boys seemed approachable at all, a couple from Dublin
        who told us all about being robbed in Prague. They
        invited us to join their table, where we were treated to
        an excellent view of what is probably the best drag show
        I have ever seen in the western world. The highlight was
        a tribute to &quot;Hair&quot;, with expert choreography
        and excerpts from virtually all the show&#146;s songs
        &#150;in Hungarian. It was refreshing to see drag
        performed without any lip-synching at all, and one
        girl&#146;s voice was so good it sent shivers up our
        spines. </font></p>

        agouti hut in Balatonfenyves, 62 km </b></font><p><font size="2" face="Arial">Staying out until 2 a.m. drinking
        heavily is seldom a brilliant idea the day before you
        plan to get up early and bicycle. We could hardly resist
        going out just one more time before leaving so we showed
        especially bad judgment on our last night in Budapest. We
        had to. This city has a contagious energy like New York
        or Rome and it had infected us. The busy streets filled
        with Hungarians and foreigners milling about at all hours
        begged us to come join them. The cafés and restaurants
        hummed with feverish conversation on this warm September
        night. The night before we&#146;d foregone the night out.
        We were too exhausted emotionally from the movie we saw.
        David Lynch&#146;s &quot;Lost Highway&quot; left my brain
        aching and wondering what David&#146;s universe looks
        like.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Similarly, my head was
        ringing at seven when the sun first woke me in our little
        Victorian furnished apartment in Shandor&#146;s guest
        house. I&#146;d only had five hours of sleep and the
        beers and scotch I&#146;d consumed the night before
        weren&#146;t helping. The one saving grace is that I had
        packed the day before. At least there was once chore
        I&#146;d been spared this morning. While Andy packed I
        went to seek breakfast. We both were craving an
        EggMcMuffin and some delicious Hungarian pastries. I
        scored on the pastry front but struck-out on the McDo
        fare. Seems that Ronald only serves burgers etc., in
        Hungary. Surprisingly at eight in the morning they had a
        full house of locals munching this fare in lieu of a real
        breakfast.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Again, the TrainBrats
        decided to use another form of transportation to avoid
        Budapest&#146;s traffic exiting the biggest Eastern
        European capital we&#146;d been to. Even so on the way to
        the train station we had more than one incident. First a
        bus ran us off the road, not surprising, it was the fifth
        time for me and I&#146;d come to expect it from the
        charming horn honking bastards. Just a little later I
        stopped my bike to allow a merging motorist to pass. She
        stopped her smoke belching Skoda and I motioned her to
        go. She gesticulated wildly insisting that I go in front
        of her as traffic all around honked. I did as she asked
        and as I passed in front of her commie car she lurched
        forward, clipping my rear pannier. I lost control and
        fell to the ground in the street. Unhurt but shaken up I
        got up launched into a diatribe against her while she hid
        her face in her hands. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">After my drama the rest of
        the trip to the train station was uneventful through my
        hangover haze. As usual it was a challenge get bikes to
        the tracks, but Andy somehow managed to find a way to
        sneak up the baggage handlers ramp. Once on the train I
        dozed after eating a few bites of the nasty sandwiches I
        bought in the station. In our car a chainsmoking woman
        grimaced at us and acted angry about our bikes. She
        changed her seat in the car three or four times before
        settling in behind us, coughing consumptively and blowing
        smoke in our direction.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Soon we arrived at the
        huge lake which we intended to ride along. We managed to
        find quiet little paths along the lakefront for most of
        the afternoon. The enormous pale green body of water was
        obviously the big Hungarian tourist attraction. The
        beaches and roads were quiet; few tourists remaining this
        late in the season. All of the signs were in German,
        sometimes accompanied by Hungarian. This must be where
        Franz and Hiedi spend there summer every year because it
        is cheap. We lunched lakeside in a café where you could
        order in any language as long as it was German. Still
        suffering from the night before but feeling better after
        a beer, we decided we&#146;d make it a short day.
        Actualizing that plan was not as easy as it seemed. Many
        of the campgrounds and hotels were only interested in
        having us as guests if we were interested in staying more
        than one day. After some search we found a little place
        advertising tourist information. They tried to refer us
        back to the Hotels we&#146;d just been to. We pointed to
        the sign that indicated that they had a &quot;Zimmer
        Frei&quot;. A little flustered, the staff finally showed
        us a tiny cottage just next to the office. It was just
        big enough for us to fit our bikes downstairs and barely
        pass upstairs to sleep. I slept poorly even though I was
        exhausted. I couldn&#146;t have a shower because the
        water was cold and was uncomfortable as I stuck to the
        sheets. Andy loved our agouti hut by the lake and slept
        soundly, dreaming of how cheap it was.</font></p>
