        <td><font size="2" face="Arial"><strong>Monday, 30
        December 1996, Vinales to Las Terrazas, 75 miles</strong></font><p><font size="2" face="Arial">Our goal for the day was Las
        Terrazas and the swank Hotel Moka. It was 75 miles, the
        vast majority of them against a ruthless wind. After a
        breakfast of coffee, juice and pizza (without the ham
        this time, thank you) at Dagoberto&#146;s, we made our
        way back to the Northern &quot;highway&quot;, which was
        nicely shaded for the first mile or two. There were times
        after that, though, where we felt like we were riding
        through glue, and the many hills were no help. Fifty
        traffic-free miles later we were in Bahia Honda,
        exhausted and out of water. Another pizza stand appeared,
        this one offering pizza al pescado. We got the last two
        and they were doubleplustasty, as was the mystery drink
        the man served us and the peanuty bar we shared for
        desert. He also filled our water bottles &#150;all for
        less than a quarter U.S. We asked around and confirmed
        that Las Terrazas was only 30k or so more. One guy said
        there was one hill. The option was to stay in town, but
        the Moka beckoned. I traded bags with Fred so I could
        enjoy my turn as the pack animal. A mistake, it turns
        out, since there were way more than 30k and way way more
        than one hill. From the turnoff 6k out of Bahia Honda the
        road plunged up and down through some of the most rugged
        terrain we&#146;ve ever biked across. The only thing that
        kept us going was the gorgeous scenery and knowing that
        comfort awaited us at the road&#146;s end.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Out of curiosity (and
        despair), I tried flagging down a passing vehicle and it
        actually stopped: a filthy flatbed truck carrying several
        people and one other bike. The other passengers helped
        get us and our stuff aboard and an aura of solidarity
        prevailed. These were good communists, I thought, and
        wouldn&#146;t ask us for money. But we didn&#146;t get a
        chance to find out. After rattling along for less than a
        kilometer, a flat tire announced itself noisily. And
        right at the bottom of a nasty nasty hill, we soon
        discovered. The other guy on a bike got to the top at the
        same time as us, and he walked the whole way (nearly a
        mile). He said he was going to Las Terrazas too, and
        promised us that we had just climbed the last hill. We
        offered him water, which he turned down, and rum, which
        he accepted. He told us his name was Daniel, and that he
        had made a 100k loop himself that day on his Flying
        Pigeon, to visit his dad in Cabanas. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Daniel kept up with us the
        whole way back to Las Terrazas, an 11k pump that was
        anything but flat. When we rolled into the odd little
        community he invited us to the local bar for a soda-y
        drink and boasted to his friends how he had kept up with
        us, pedaling up every hill save the
        motherfuckinglomaofdeath. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">One last hill remained, up
        to the hotel. At the top, Conchita (what Doctora Maria de
        la Concepcion Perez-Eiriz is called by her friends) was a
        vision, her smiling face assuring us that our room was
        ready; would we care to go to the bar for our welcome
        cocktail?</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Bath, booze and backgammon
        were the pre-dinner activities, and the cheesy American
        movie on TV (&quot;Ghost&quot;) was perfect fare for our
        sun-baked brains before bedtime.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The next day the Moka was
        fully booked, but we decided to decompress poolside until
        lunchtime anyway and see if anything opened up. If not,
        it was a relatively easy 50 miles to Havana. But at noon
        Conchita told us we could stay. We decided to walk to
        some supposedly close-by natural swimming pools in the
        afternoon &#150;the longest 3 kilometers I&#146;ve ever
        walked. We were accompanied by a young soldier returning
        home from his post at Havana&#146;s airport, who politely
        answered every question I asked him yet never addressed a
        single word to me.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The river was well worth
        the schlep, a truly gorgeous swimming hole with
        refreshingly cool water. While swimming and soaking we
        met two older homos (a couple? We never did find out).
        Both were named Jens, and one was German, the other
        Norwegian. Also in their odd little entourage was one of
        the Jens&#146; brothers, his black Cuban girlfriend, his
        teenage daughter and her gangly boyfriend. We hitched a
        ride back with them and accepted their invitation to join
        them on an excursion to a nearby coffee plantation, the
        Bella Vista, which lived up to its name. Two guides
        showed us around the place, pointing out the drying
        areas, the grindstone, the slave quarters, and the old
        house which the French imperialist owner had occupied.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">This excursion was
        followed by beers at the Las Terrazas boathouse, where we
        all got better acquainted and slightly inebriated as we
        watched the sun go down. Fred and I dined al fresco at a
        paladar run out of someone&#146;s kitchen. Conchita had
        steered us there earlier, and we had made reservations. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Mercedes, the
        paladar&#146;s proprietress, who also worked at the
        hotel, cooked us what was far and away the best meal we
        had in Cuba. Even the service &#150;in the person of her
        cute son&#151;was impeccable. The china had conspicuously
        come from the hotel, however, making us wonder yet again
        what the deal was with this model village, which looked
        nothing like anything else we&#146;d seen in Cuba:
        harmonious architecture in a beautiful setting, a
        prosperous-looking populace with no visible means of
        support (the German&#146;s Cuban girlfriend said they all
        worked at the tiny hotel, but that was patently false)
        and several well-stocked bars, each with uniformed
        service personnel. It felt vaguely like an episode of
        &quot;The Prisoner,&quot; Cuban style. Even so, this
        sanitized version of Cuba felt exactly right as a buffer
        between Vinales and Havana, on this penultimate day of
        1996.</font></p>

        December, 1996 - Wednesday, 1 January, 1997, Las Terrazas
        to Habana, 50 miles</strong></font><p><font size="2" face="Arial">We took our autopista most of the way back
        the next morning, and it was a markedly different
        experience with a headwind that halved our previous speed
        and tripled our efforts. I even had a flat time, the only
        one of our entire trip. Still, it had its nostalgic
        aspect, seeing the same road from a different
        perspective. We were much wiser to the ways of this weird
        island country when we pulled up to a lakeside commie
        café that had refused to serve us on Christmas. This
        time, my pesos were accepted gladly, and the other
        customers seemed to find us amusing, going so far as to
        offer us food that they had brought along. One of them, a
        tall 40-ish guy on his way back to Havana, joined us on
        his ten-speed. He even took his turn breaking the wind
        for us. We turned off the autopista before he did, and
        headed north for the coast, in order to get a different
        approach into Havana.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">It was indeed different
        from the scruffiness of the urban part of the autopista.
        We rode through miles upon miles of tree-lined suburbs,
        the streets jammed with people on bikes. We stopped at a
        fast-food joint that looked like it had been transported
        there from California &#150;all gleaming steel and frosty
        a/c; and dollars, only, please. The burger, of course,
        was all but inedible, but the ice cream from the
        similarly posh place next door was delish. From there,
        the neighborhoods got even glitzier. Embassies started
        cropping up in an area called Miramar, and the stream of
        bicycles turned into a river as we crossed the bridge to
        Vedado, where our hotel was located and where the
        aesthetic changed radically. The impression is
        overwhelming: Havana is a very large, very planned and
        elegant city, exactly thirty-eight years after a nuclear
        explosion.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Our hotel was one of the
        taller ruins, and therefore easy to find. Familiar
        bellhops greeted us, but told us the manager
        wouldn&#146;t allow the bikes in the room. So we employed
        Cuban logic and disassembled them right at the
        hotel&#146;s entrance, and claimed our box that we had
        left in storage. It was quite a spectacle, and Fred and I
        worked with supreme efficiency and speed. We even fit the
        fourth wheel in this time. And the manager had no problem
        with our taking the box up with us.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The receptionist had given
        us a much nicer room than before, with original 30&#146;s
        furniture and a huge bed. Of course the bellhops found
        this unacceptable, and apologized while saying they could
        change it. I assured them we were used to sleeping in a
        single bed; I hope they figured it out that we were
        bourgeois degenerate perverts.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">We decided to walk to La
        Habana Vieja &#150;the old part of the city&#151;some
        miles away. The initial shock of the sorry physical state
        of the place never wore off. Block after block of
        once-grand buildings in an identical state of decay, the
        streets increasingly filled with people and garbage as we
        approached the historical center. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">It wasn&#146;t long before
        we were hit up for cash. It was a couple, with the man
        doing all the talking and the woman doing all the
        coughing. Their pitch was flawless: they needed three
        Yankee dollars for an asthma inhaler available only at
        the pharmacy for tourists. As chance would have it, they
        had unknowingly hit upon one of the few methods capable
        of getting empathy from Fred, a fellow asthma sufferer.
        He instructed me to give them a buck before promising he
        wouldn&#146;t allow himself to be swindled any more. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The incident put us on
        guard for our next such encounter. A handsome youth
        approached us along the Malecon &#150;Havana&#146;s
        poignantly dilapidated seaside promenade&#151;and swore
        to us that he didn&#146;t want anything from us beyond
        conversation and the exchange of ideas. He quickly fell
        into tour guide mode, explaining that the salty air was
        what destroyed the buildings. When we reached the mouth
        of the harbor some blocks later he pointed out the
        various fortresses. Fred had grown uncomfortable with
        having this character tagging along, and had me explain
        that we really would prefer to be alone. At this point,
        of course, the boy asked us for compensation for his
        services &#150;something he promised us he wouldn&#146;t
        do earlier. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Warily, we headed inland
        along a beautiful boulevard with a tree-lined walkway
        down the middle. Touts and whores approached us with what
        became a constant litany of come-ons. We stumbled upon
        the Caribbean Hotel, where the cyclists we met on
        Christmas said they worked, and went inside to seek
        refuge from the human garbage on the street. We
        recognized Lazaro instantly. He was sweeping, and looked
        younger and cuter than I had remembered. He recognized us
        too, and sat down with us in the dreary lobby for coffee.
        He told us of the difficulties of maintaining a racing
        bike in Cuba. His own bike had taken eight years to
        assemble, and he had to be very careful not to break any
        parts, since they were nigh impossible to replace. We
        invited him to dinner, but he had made plans with his
        family. New Year&#146;s Eve, we learned, is a
        family-oriented holiday in Cuba.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">We wandered around Old
        Havana for many hours. Pimps, whores and other scumbags
        continued to approach us. In an alleyway near the
        cathedral a guy invited us to eat in his family&#146;s
        paladar, exclaiming in the same breath that he had ganja
        and cocaine (&quot;nieve&quot;) for sale. We sought
        further escape from the steady hustler-hassle at la
        Floridita, a tourist trap bar that fancies itself
        &quot;the cradle of the daiquiri.&quot; It had been a
        favorite haunt of Hemingway, and there were photos of him
        everywhere. In one, he was shown smiling conspiratorially
        with Fidel, their two heads nearly touching. At six bucks
        apiece (no pesos in the till here), the daiquiris did
        taste pretty good. We inquired about dinner in the
        gorgeous adjacent dining room, but they told us they were
        full for la nochebuena. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">After poking our noses in
        various hotel restaurants (that of the Sevilla was the
        most glam, but also fully booked) and getting an address
        of a paladar from Lazaro, we settled on a state-run pasta
        joint next to the Floridita. After such a tough pedal
        into town, my body was craving carbohydrates. The food
        turned our to be decent, though hardly worth the
        interminable wait and lousy commie-style service that put
        Trufina to shame. Entertainment was provided by a nearby
        table, where a young pimp (&quot;jinatero&quot; in Cuban
        Spanish) attempted to procure whores for three unsavory
        East-European types. Girl after girl was brought in and
        offered up, yet none seemed to be to their liking.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">We continued wandering
        after dinner. On the main tourist street we peeked into
        all the bars in search of a homo scene, but finally found
        it in the street. Or should I say it found us? A guy
        started talking to me as we walked down the eerily dark
        street (Havana is virtually free of outdoor illumination
        of any kind), and I could tell right away that he
        wasn&#146;t trying to sell me anything. His voice was
        soft and steady as he engaged in the universal homo
        butt-sniff. He was accompanied by a smiling well-groomed
        partner and I muttered to Fred that we had finally made
        contact with homo Cuba.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">I asked if there was
        anyplace we could go for a drink and we ended up in a
        nearly deserted (and decidedly non-gay) beer garden on
        the Malecon. Our friends were called Lorenzo and Juan,
        and after much small talk we learned they had been
        together since meeting at a queer party only a couple of
        months earlier. Juan had a rodenty appearance and worked
        in a cigar factory, while the perpetually smiling Lorenzo
        cooked in a convent. Both were losing their hair despite
        their being in their low thirties (or so they said). I
        had to translate everything for Fred, who wanted to
        return to the hotel to take some cough medicine. Lorenzo
        and Juan proposed that we follow them to a party they
        knew about, but Fred&#146;s coughing took precedence
        (which was fine by me, since I was exhausted from the
        long day) and soon we were in a taxi speeding along the
        Malecon back towards Vedado.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Fred was snoring by eleven
        and I made a point of turning off the light by 11:45.
        1997 could wait.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">We woke up early, of
        course. It was our last day in Cuba and the first day of
        an historic year for us. Our only plan was to wander, and
        to try to visit the Museum of the Revolution. Both of
        these goals were accomplished with ease. We also
        continued our visitation of Havana&#146;s finer hotels.
        We zigzagged through the faded glories of Vedado to the
        gargantuan Havana Libre, formerly the Hilton. Most of the
        floors were closed for renovations, and the hideous
        airplane hanger of a lobby was sad beyond description.
        The nearby University of Havana &#150;perched atop a
        hill&#151;hooked pretty good though. As we approached the
        seaside and our goal &#150;the famous Hotel
        Nacional&#151;the streets grew shabbier and shabbier.
        Across from the Nacional&#146;s entrance was an extensive
        mural of political cartoons denouncing the Helms-Burton
        act.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The Nacional is supposedly
        Cuba&#146;s fanciest hotel, but it didn&#146;t look so
        great to us. The lobby was filled with unspeakably tatty
        Caribbean communist-style furniture, and the grounds were
        impressive only by virtue of their size and setting. We
        had bloody mary&#146;s in a bar filled with photos of
        famous guests, overlooking an empty swimming pool. Whores
        still in their evening garb drank with their clients and
        squinted in the sun. We then climbed to the
        &quot;mirador&quot; for an awesome view of the destroyed
        city.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The Museum of the
        Revolution held few surprises beyond the fact that the
        price of admission could only be paid in imperialist
        &quot;yanqui&quot; dollars. It is housed in the former
        presidential palace and its displays detail the guerrilla
        actions of Fidel and his pals in excruciating detail. One
        striking feature was the use of relics &#150;various
        items of apparel once worn by revolutionaries now housed
        in glass cases. The Che Guevara shrine was particularly
        rich in such relics, including the bloodstained shirt in
        which he died in Bolivia. In a garden at the rear of the
        building we visited the Granma Memorial, where
        revolutionary vehicles are displayed with a similarly
        religious reverence, punctuated by various twisted chunks
        of a yanqui plane shot down in the Bay of Pigs invasion.
        Armed soldiers watched our every move as we viewed the
        sacred objects, barking at us if we tried to move in a
        direction contrary to the posted arrows.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">After a quick siesta back
        at the hotel we taxied to the Plaza de Armas in a private
        taxi, a 1958 Pontiac rustbucket. We walked to the nearby
        cathedral and had coffee while listening to a fantastic
        band in a heavily touristed café, after which we
        ventured off the beaten path into the less savory parts
        of la Habana Vieja. No one bothered us on these ruined
        streets, which appeared to go on forever. It was like a
        set from &quot;Terminator&quot;, populated by thousands
        of people, and it felt especially creepy in the pitch
        dark after the sun had set. Fred expressed relief when we
        got back to the more illuminated calle turista that runs
        past La Floridita, our chosen spot for dinner.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The meal was a
        disappointment, despite the elegant dining room and
        perfect daiquiris. Both the food and the service were
        substandard, and obscenely overpriced. On the way to our
        rendezvous with Juan and Lorenzo, we stopped to hobnob
        with a group of young queens in front of the opera house.
        Unlike our older gay friends, these four boys were
        screamingly, vividly queer. One spoke French reasonably
        well, and another said he was in the corps of the
        National Ballet. We would have spent more time with these
        boys had we not promised our more staid friends that
        we&#146;d meet them for a drink. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">We met Juan and Lorenzo on
        the steps of the Capitolio, now a science library, and
        apparently the epicenter of queer Havana. They said that
        the party they tried to go to the night before turned out
        to be an extra-private affair, and that they knew of
        nothing scheduled for this night. Curious as we were to
        get a better glimpse of the underground homo scene, we
        also had to be at the airport at 5:30 in the morning. So
        it was with a mixture of disappointment and relief that
        we proposed coffee on the terrace of the nearby Hotel
        Ingleterra. Lorenzo produced a card for us with New Year
        wishes from both of them, which was very touching. We
        learned from them that Castro is referred to as &quot;El
        Commandante&quot; and has no fixed residence in Havana,
        since he is constantly hiding from the C.I.A. When we had
        said our good byes, Fred and I had a hell of a time
        finding a taxi and nearly had to walk back along the
        creepy Malecon. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">We had arranged a private
        taxi to pick us up at five in the morning. He also served
        as our wake up call. I made him promise that he would
        drive slowly, but given the state of his old clunker,
        this wasn&#146;t really a concern. Our mammoth box tied
        to the roof of his antique Lada, we plunged through the
        darkness of the Havana streets while listening to our
        elderly-but-robust driver ranting again El Commandante.
        He called him &quot;El Viejo&quot; or &quot;El
        Loco,&quot; though. It was the first we had heard anyone
        saying anything against Castro. In line at the airport
        counter we met with a hetero couple from Santa Barbara, a
        competitive cyclist and his photographer girlfriend, both
        of whom were looking sickeningly glamorous for six in the
        morning. It was their second time in Cuba, and they had
        come to buy photographs, including a copy of the one we
        had seen on the wall of La Floridita of Hemingway and El
        Commandante.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The sky was just beginning
        to lighten as we crossed the tarmac and boarded the
        plane. I was missing Cuba already. </font></p>
