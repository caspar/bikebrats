        March, Sydney (f)</b></font><p><font size="2" face="Arial">Much to surprise of all of our friends,
        we&#146;d always planned to arrive the day after
        Sydney&#146;s famed gala event, the Gay and Lesbian Mardi
        Gras. The frenzied party is just too much for us as we
        advance in age. We landed, put our bikes together and
        found our way to town. Bicycle assembly took just a
        little longer than it should have. For some odd reason
        the brake cables had been detached from their anchors on
        the brakes in front, forcing me to adjust them before we
        could leave. Making me appreciate the job our mechanic,
        Wade Dollar of Sun Cycles in Phoenix, had done on our
        retreat all the more.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Oddly enough Sydney&#146;s
        normally neurotic drivers were calm, so the ride to town
        was almost calming. We got lost along the way and we just
        asked a group of Mardi Gras revelers on the street how to
        find Jonathan&#146;s house. The leather-panted
        sequin-bloused disco bunny on the remnants of a speed and
        ecstasy trip didn&#146;t know Jonathan by name but he did
        know the street. Our gracious host didn&#146;t even
        flinch when we rolled our beasts into his apartment, but
        he was a little shocked by our burden. His boyfriend du
        jour, Michel, was most enchanting and we both fell head
        over heels for him. Almost too beautiful to look at, I
        found it difficult to concentrate in his often scantily
        clad presence.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Mardi Gras&#146; shock
        waves were still to be felt that evening. Several of the
        bars hosted &quot;recovery&quot; parties, which seemed
        just another excuse to have too much to drink or whatever
        and dance. We witnessed one errant discoer slip into a
        seizure at one bar in the middle of the dance floor. Most
        seemed to care little about his near brush with death and
        kept dancing while his friends tried to revive him before
        carrying him downstairs to get medical attention.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The bedlam continued chez
        Jonathan; the comings and goings were non-stop during our
        visit. Even with all the craziness, he cooked us a
        marvelous blueberry pancake breakfast our first day and
        took the best care possible of us. The second night we
        hosted a &quot;Mini-Party&quot; at Jonathan&#146;s where
        we all watched the Mardi Gras Parade on television.
        Participant after participant streamed by, each with more
        and more sequins as the queeny host and bitchy drag
        commentators dis&#146;ed every passerby --all on national
        network television. Imagine the San Francisco or New York
        Gay Pride Parades getting coverage like that!</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Though I like Sydney and
        all the distraction of a big city, I was ready to leave
        our third morning. Good fortune was with us on our
        departure. Our dear friends from Copenhagen Niels and
        Tomas were in town for the festivities and were ready to
        take a road trip with us. They&#146;d even hinted that
        they wanted to ride a bit. I owe a special debt of
        gratitude towards Niels, who acted as my guardian angel
        last summer when I dislocated my shoulder. He gave me a
        great place to stay while I recovered.</font></p>

        Sydney/Newcastle to Shoal Bay, 55km (guest writer/rider:
        Tomas Oppermann)</b></font><p><font size="2" face="Arial">After
        Niels and I had experienced the Sydney Mardi Gras, it was
        time to meet Fred and Andrew and to go north with them.
        Niels and I rented a car and went to Jonathan&#146;s to
        pick up the luggage of the two Bikebrats. Then we were to
        drive to Newcastle and Fred and Andrew were to take the
        train. Of course Niels and I took a wrong turn and almost
        had to go all the way back to Sydney, after we had driven
        about 60 km. We made it to Newcastle only half an hour
        later than the train-travelers. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">It was soon decided that
        Fred and I were riding. We started from the station in
        Newcastle where an elderly &quot;sweetheart&quot; gave us
        directions to the boat to the other side of the water.
        When we got off the boat the riding began and it was very
        fast discovered that you couldn&#146;t ride two next to
        each other, as a bus nearly ran us down. I was quite glad
        when Niels and Andrew passed us and stopped, because I
        was riding in my swimsuit and could now change to cycling
        shorts. After riding a while we met Niels and Andrew
        again &#150; this time for cold drinks and a snack in a
        tiny village called Bob&#146;s Farm. How nice to have a
        service team scouting in advance and securing basic
        needs.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The day went well and the
        55 kilometers did not scare any of us away. We passed the
        first koala road sign, although this one probably was
        erected by a real estate broker trying to improve the
        image of a new neighborhood. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">After the ride, we still
        had enough energy to climb the 190-meter Tomaree Head.
        Estimated time was 1 hour but this young and healthy team
        did the expedition in only half an hour; due to sunset
        and hunger we speeded up.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The evening was spent in
        Shoal Bay next to Nelson Bay. Both bays had seen better
        days when they served as the Monte Carlo of Sydney. Today
        they represent a living museum of how nice things used to
        be. We truly enjoyed this retro atmosphere and were quite
        fond of Shoal Bay until we received a parking ticket the
        next day for violating the one-hour parking in this empty
        town.</font></p>

        <td width="100%"><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>4 March,
        Shoal Bay to Forster, 114km (a)</b></font><p><font size="2" face="Arial">Fred and I had to creep out of our
        apartment this morning in order to make our 8:30 boat
        without waking our Danish friends. We arrived at the port
        early and had breakfast at a friendly little café there.
        Both the owners and other patrons proffered abundant
        advice as to our route, and told us about the
        &quot;mountain&quot; we&#146;d have to climb at
        Buladelah. Scanning the flat horizon, I shrugged this off
        as yet more Australian hyperbole. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Save an elderly Australian
        couple, we were the only passengers aboard the tiny ferry
        to Tea Gardens, across a huge inlet known as Port
        Stephens. Our captain was a friendly young guy called Tim
        who said he&#146;d stop if he spotted any dolphins, and
        that the chances for a sighting stood at around 95%. As
        we reached our destination, I was beginning to think that
        our cruise belonged to that other 5%, but felt I had
        received sufficient entertainment value for my dollar
        from our co-passenger. When I told him we were traveling
        on to Indonesia, he said he&#146;d spent some time there,
        &quot;stuck in the bush and starving on Timor.&quot; He
        had been stationed at an airbase there during the war.
        When the Japanese attacked without warning, his unit was
        instructed to destroy as much as they could and hide in
        the jungle. His unit was &quot;expendable,&quot; he said,
        so they were elated to make radio contact with an
        American submarine after two months of chewing on bark in
        the forest. When the sub arrived, it sent out a launch,
        which couldn&#146;t get beyond the breakwater, and since
        the Australians were too weakened to swim, they had to be
        hauled by a rope through water teeming with sharks.
        &quot;There was thirty-four of us and forty Yanks, so we
        were pretty cramped in that little sub. The worst part,
        though, was when the engine room caught fire. Still, I
        made it back in one piece and I&#146;ve been grateful to
        Americans ever since. They didn&#146;t have to save us,
        you know.&quot; Later, with his wife patiently surveying
        the waters for swimming mammals and me up in the bridge
        with captain Tim, he told Fred the same tale. Then, just
        as we were pulling into port, two gray objects jumped out
        of the water &#150;a dolphin and her calf. Tim said he
        couldn&#146;t get too close since dolphin moms are very
        protective, while the &quot;teenage ones practically jump
        in the boat.&quot; </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Back on shore, my first
        impression of Australian roads was their miserable state
        of repair. It was as if an unstirred stew of rocks and
        tar had been haphazardly strewn upon the soil. We bumped
        and jostled our way across a bridge known as the
        &quot;Singing Bridge&quot; for the sound it makes when
        the wind blows across it (not today, thankfully) and into
        the vast and deserted Myall Lakes National Park. The road
        here was gloriously free of traffic, protected from the
        wind by dunes on one side and thick &quot;bush&quot;
        (Australian for forest) on the other. Apart from the
        sound of our wheels whirring on the sorry excuse for
        pavement, all we could hear were the exotic squawkings
        and buzzings of unfamiliar birds and insects. I kept
        scouring the treetops for koalas, with no success.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">To get a view of the
        beach, we rode to the top of one of the lower (and more)
        accessible dunes, where two long-haired rocker types from
        Newcastle were both peering mysteriously through
        high-powered binoculars. Something about them made Fred
        and me think they were members of our tribe, but neither
        of us bothered to ask. Instead, we continued to push our
        way northwards, past magnificent lakes (lagoons, really)
        full of black swans and jumping fish. After over thirty
        km of this cycling bliss, we boarded another ferry back
        to the &quot;mainland.&quot; &#150;this time an old cable
        ferry covering a distance that could be swum across in
        about a minute. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The other side had one
        nasty little surprise for us: the road leading to
        Buladelah, our intended lunch stop, was gravel; there
        were even a few hills. But the scenery &#150;verdant cow
        pastures fringed in thick eucalyptus and crowned with
        rocky outcroppings&#151;was magnificent, so the 16
        kilometers of taint torture went by quickly.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Buladelah looked to me
        like a classic Australian rural town, with a dusty main
        street that looked straight out of a cowboy flick. It was
        hotter than hell. We stopped in the most
        palatable-looking place for lunch, and were surprised to
        find it run by a trio of Sapphic womyn. As well as
        cooking up awesome veggie burgers, they sold local
        crafts, garage-sale bric-a-brac, and a variety of healing
        herbs. The whole ambiance was very &quot;Fried Green
        Tomatoes&quot;, which, combined with the air
        conditioning, made it a very hard place to leave. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">From Buladelah the going
        got very tough indeed. First we rode a bit along the main
        Pacific Highway, which didn&#146;t strike us as busy at
        all, and then headed back towards the coast through a
        chain of very high hills. While beautiful (and
        providentially shaded for the most part), the route
        required more effort than was ideal on such a hot day.
        The sweat streamed off us. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">During the last part of
        day we had to grapple with twin evils of a killer
        headwind and increasing traffic. These were mitigated
        somewhat by the pretty views riding along the shores of
        Myall, Smith and Wallis lakes, and the sea breeze here
        cooled things off considerably. We stopped at the only
        business for miles around, the general store in a place
        called Bungwahl (three guesses to come up with the
        BikeBrats moniker). The young, rugbyesque shopkeeper was
        a living stereotype, an overgrown fratboy incapable of
        constructing an utterance not including the word
        &quot;mate&quot; (pronounced &quot;might&quot; in
        Australian). Like all of his ilk, he queried us on our
        mad voyage, showing his approval of our efforts with
        copious use of another Australianism, &quot;good on
        you&quot; (pronounced &quot;g&#146;donya&quot;), which
        we&#146;ve come to interpret as &quot;well done&quot; or
        &quot;good for you.&quot; As we sat outside rehydrating
        ourselves, barefoot locals would burst upon the scene,
        shouting incomprehensibly (except for the word
        &quot;mate&quot; that is) to their businessman friend
        inside and reemerge carrying beer, ice cream or both. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Back in Foster Bay, I had
        left Niels and Tomas a map with both Buladelah and
        Bungwahl circled as possible relay posts, and figured
        we&#146;d run across him one way or the other. But as we
        rolled into Forster late in the afternoon there was still
        no sign of them. To find them we dialed Niels&#146;
        mobile number in Denmark and learned they were already
        checked into a motel, having missed us during our long
        lunch break. We found them frolicking in the pool, and
        jumped in to join them in our scrungy biking gear (for
        the sake of future guests, we hope the water is heavily
        chlorinated). </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">A sunset walk along the
        seaside provided the day&#146;s only major drama when I
        stepped on a stringy, electric blue jellyfish. It stung
        horribly, and made me feel like I might have an allergic
        reaction. Holding the shot of epinephrine I&#146;ve
        carried with me since a bad reaction to fire ants in
        Texas ten years ago, I let Niels drive me to the nearby
        hospital. It was a tiny place, full of people apologizing
        that it&#146;s a private hospital and I might actually
        have to pay. Nearly employing the overused Australianism
        &quot;No worries,&quot; I told them that, as an American,
        I&#146;m used to paying for health care. Thanks to an
        effective triage process, I got out of there without
        spending a dime. They put me on the phone to a poison
        hotline, where an authoritative woman&#146;s voice told
        me that the only problem caused by &quot;blue-bottle
        jellyfish&quot; was the intense pain from their stings.
        Armed with this information (and immensely relieved), I
        happily popped a Vicadin back at our motel and joined the
        others in the nightly search for dinner.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Although inveterate
        meat-and-potato eater Tomas was a little reticent about
        it, we decided upon a Mexican place for dinner. The food
        was surprisingly good, but the service was abysmal. It
        took nearly an hour for our guacamole appetizer to
        arrive. We killed a portion of this excruciatingly long
        wait by checking out the view of the moon from a massive
        telescope set up at the optometrist&#146;s next door, at
        $2 a peek. Over dinner &#150;where the high point was
        Fred barking &quot;come here&quot; to the inattentive
        waitroid-- it was established that Tomas and Niels would
        be riding tomorrow. Niels tells me that the highest point
        in Denmark is 190 meters, an altitude we surpassed
        several times today. For their benefit, I&#146;m hoping
        that tomorrow&#146;s ride will be gentler. </font></p>

        will be a simple ride&#146;, said Andrew and continued,
        &#145;You will have a tail wind and no serious
        hills&#146;. With this in mind, Tomas and I left Forester
        after a relaxed breakfast in this off-peak holiday twin
        town. We had agreed to swap means of transportation,
        implying that we would get Fred and Andrew&#146;s
        well-tuned bikes and they would get our air-conditioned
        rental car. It would soon turn out that bikeriding around
        the world with two pair of underwear is more hard work
        than an easy holiday.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Shortly after our start,
        an old lady took a left turn right in front of me,
        forcing me to an immediate and complete stop. This was an
        early warning of the inconsiderate Australian driver.
        Along the suicidal main road along the ocean, Tomas and I
        were both scared of the speed and proximity of the
        drivers. We were looking forward to the promised land on
        the quiet roads. Soon our hopes were fulfilled and we
        turned away from the main road and onto a nice quiet
        route that Andrew and Fred had found for us. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">For some odd reason Andrew
        suggested an alternative route than the one indicated in
        their Cycling Australia bible. Referring to Andrew this
        new route was shorter and more decorative. Reality was
        that after a few romantic kilometers this route turned
        into HELL. Gravel roads with huge holes combined with
        steep hills and an ever increasingly burning sun. Fred
        and Andrew themselves got lost in the maze of dirt roads
        with our rental car surviving bridges breaking under it.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">After some hours in
        Lucifer&#146;s back garden, we finally met the BikeBrats.
        Tomas was exchanged with Andrew, and Andrew and I
        finished the day in Wingham after an exhausting finale on
        the hilly roads of New South Wales.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">As if this wasn&#146;t
        enough we decided to drive by car to the Ellenborough
        waterfall 45 km away from Wingham, partly on dirt road of
        course. Having enjoyed the falls for a few minutes, we
        rushed back to Wingham to see the tens of thousands of
        bats living in a planted piece of rain forest near the
        center of town. The big event, however, was to see the
        bats leave their residence at sunset and while waiting
        for this to take place some very friendly Winghammers
        offered us predinner cocktails on the sidewalk that we
        occupied. Many thanks go to Ian, Ariana, Kaly and Tayla
        of Wingham for this generous act.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The evening ended in the
        most fancy (and only) Italian BYO restaurant in Wingham.
        Andrew brought Moet &amp; Chandon champagne to celebrate
        our last evening together this time. Thank you for a
        fantastic mini-week and thank you for not forcing me to
        bike around the world.</font></p>

        <td width="100%"><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>The
        Batwatch, Wingham (f)</b></font><p><font size="2" face="Arial">Our walk through the natural reserve at
        Wingham was much anticipated. We&#146;d been reading
        about the huge community of flying foxes for days and
        couldn&#146;t wait to have a look. On the way to the
        reserve there was a little preview of things to come.
        Strolling through the disproportionately vast public
        square that was too enormous to be surrounded completely
        by public edifices we noticed a bat hanging from the
        power lines. We were excited for the opportunity to see
        one so close and not obstructed by branches and leaves of
        trees. Closer inspection revealed that the poor creature
        had accidentally decided to light there and was
        electrocuted yet remained suspended from the wires.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">It was already getting
        towards dusk as we arrived at the park. We hiked the
        trail through the park underneath the canopy with our
        eyes searching the upper branches for bats. We&#146;d
        walked nearly the whole park without seeing a single one.
        Later we&#146;d all mused about seeing all of these
        unusual fruits hanging in the trees but none actually had
        noticed a bat. While looking up at the upper reaches of a
        great tree whose trunk was textured with the folds of its
        roots one of the &quot;fruits&quot; flapped its wings. It
        was at that moment that we realized that there were
        thousands and thousands of really big bats above us. Some
        sported wingspans over one meter and looked more like
        dogs with wings than bats.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">As it began to grow dark
        we started home through residential Wingham, where you
        could here a pin drop it was so quiet and calm. Parkside,
        a few elderly neighbors were chatting about their busy
        days when we happened by. It struck me at that moment
        that the bats were likely to leave the park en masse at
        any moment, and verified this with the gossips. They
        confirmed, so we sat down on the lawn of the house next
        door and awaited the show. As we sat watching for the
        bats and feeding the hummingbird-sized mosquitoes with
        our warm blood the &quot;woman-of-the-house&quot; arrived
        seemingly surprised by our presence in her yard. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">A few moments later they
        released their vicious attack dog out the front door
        following it outside to mop up our remains. The
        twelve-ounce beast barked ferociously as it advanced on
        me, turning over on its back for a good tummy rubbing as
        soon as I reached out to pet it. I joked with Ian saying
        that it &quot;looked like a barking hamster not a
        dog.&quot; Ian laughed and asked us what was up. I
        explained the situation, adding that we&#146;d been told
        &quot;that this was the best to view the bats because
        they served free drinks during bat viewing times.&quot;
        Ian laughed and went inside for beers and snacks. His
        whole family joined us on the sidewalk where we shot the
        breeze and watched the enormous winged creatures flap off
        to eat peaches in the warm summer night.</font></p>
