        to Kalmari, 102 km (a) </b></font><p><font size="2" face="Arial">We wished we could stay in blissful
        Dubrovnik for a couple of more days, but it was time to
        get back on board the Marco Polo. The crew was familiar
        from last week&#146;s trip to Split, and the voyage to
        Igoumenitsa passed uneventfully. We did meet a couple of
        young cyclists from Germany: Sasha &#150;a skinny
        sniffling boy with puppydog eyes and a nasty
        cough&#151;and his more robust and gregarious girlfriend,
        Dani. They had traveled from their Fatherland as far as
        the Romanian border, where they turned around after being
        shaken down for Deutschmarks by immigration police. Part
        of me was very relieved to hear this story. Ever since we
        made the decision in Budapest to follow the safer route
        towards Turkey, I felt like we&#146;d chickened out on a
        potentially phenomenal experience by skipping out on
        Romania. We compared notes on our respective journeys and
        were amused to find that they had suffered indignities
        similar to ours at the hands of the railway staff in the
        same shithole town in northern Croatia. Amazingly,
        neither had any real cycling experience before this trip
        and now they were on their way to India. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The next morning we met
        our new friends on deck &#150;where they had spent a
        chilly night&#151;as we approached the gritty port town
        of Igoumenitsa. Sasha&#146;s cough sounded even worse and
        we advised him to rest before tackling the mountains, not
        to mention eat something warm and substantial before
        wasting away entirely. Dani entertained us with tales of
        their recent trip through Bolivia on the back of a burro,
        a trip which was not surprisingly fraught with hardship.
        &quot;But we traveled for over six months on less than
        1000 D-marks,&quot; she proclaimed proudly. While I
        always admire people who travel on the cheap (which
        proves to me that anyone can do it if they really want
        to), I&#146;ve never quite grasped the motives of this
        certain type of budget-minded traveler who approaches his
        or her voyage as a sort of competition in which the
        object is to spend the least amount of money and endure
        the highest degree of discomfort. I would have probed her
        on this subject were it not for our boat arriving in
        port.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Once docked, we headed
        straight to the nearest travel agent in order to book
        passage on the first boat to Patras, which I calculated
        as being only two riding days to Athens. After much
        telephoning and futzing with various papers, the friendly
        but obviously incompetent salesgirl informed us that our
        ship would sail at two p.m., some four hours hence. To
        kill the time we rode up and down the unattractive
        seafront strip, stopping at various souvlaki stands and
        cafés. Dani and Sasha appeared after our second meal,
        hungrily eyeing the remnants left on our plates. When I
        invited them to help themselves, they fell on the food
        like hyenas, causing me to wonder if they had left any
        room in their budget for food. Predictably, they
        complained how expensive Greece was, saying that
        they&#146;d wanted to buy a map but it cost too much.
        Increasingly concerned for their well-being, I offered
        them the map I&#146;d just purchased, and reiterated our
        concerns over Sasha&#146;s obvious ill health. We parted
        hastily since we were due at our boat, but when we
        arrived at the dock there was no boat to be found, nor
        anyone capable of giving us the slightest shred of
        information. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Our friendly travel bimbo
        smiled and said, &quot;Oh, the boat is running late and
        won&#146;t be here for another four hours at least.&quot;
        --news which we greeted with groans, since it meant more
        time in this armpit of a town. To compensate for this
        miserable fact, we sought out and found the trendiest
        café in town, where we dug in our heels for a long
        afternoon of reading, drinking and backgammon (a
        redeeming feature of Greek cafes is that they all have
        boards).</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">When we went back to the
        travel agent at the designated hour, she informed us that
        our boat would depart even later than anticipated,
        arriving in Patras at something like 2am. This made us
        decide to book a cabin, which turned out to be a
        Kafkaesque adventure in the still-Byzantine world of
        Greek bureaucracy. Reserving the cabin &#150;not to
        mention obtaining accurate information on our ship&#146;s
        e.t.a.-- involved several more trips up and down portside
        road where we had already passed countless times.
        Frustrating as it was, at least it served to occupy the
        time, and was humorous in its way. I thought to myself
        how the locals must be beginning to wonder about us&#133;</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">When our ship finally
        pulled into port, she revealed herself to be a huge old
        Chinese vessel resembling a giant shoebox. Before we were
        able to board, we witnessed the five-act drama of
        unloading trucks. A piggy-back trailer full of cars had a
        hell of a time backing onto the dock, especially after
        one of its cars came loose and every Greek within two
        hundred meters began bellowing instructions to the
        driver. Even the relatively simple task of getting the
        key to our cabin was made into an ordeal. Worn down by
        the day&#146;s mishaps, I turned to Fred to announce
        wearily, &quot;In Greece, nothing is simple.&quot; We
        found our cabin in the middle of a labyrinth worthy of
        Knossos (we were traveling on Minoan Lines, after all).
        As our ship shuddered through the water, its muffled
        engines the only sound, I made a concerted effort to
        catch a couple of hours of fitful sleep in the
        purgatorial eeriness.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The anticipated and
        dreaded knocking at our door began at 1am, even though it
        was another two hours before we arrived in the
        unwelcoming town of Patras. After pedaling past a lively
        gypsy encampment, we found a room with little trouble;
        the half-asleep woman who managed the place even had a
        special spot for our bikes, thus earning herself a
        BikeBrats gold star. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Before heading out the
        next morning, we chatted with the hotel&#146;s staff,
        including a Finnish girl who had married the owner&#146;s
        son and moved to Patras &#150;a very bewildering decision
        indeed. I made the mistake of telling her young husband
        that we were on our way to Istanbul, which elicited a
        prolonged anti-Turk diatribe. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">We pedaled out of town
        through a confusing jumble of streets and dead ends. The
        map we bought at the first gas station wasn&#146;t of
        much use, either. At one point we pushed our bikes
        through weeds and along railroad tracks in order to
        rejoin our intended route, which led straight into a wall
        of wind. Athens was feeling farther and farther
        away&#133; </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The quiet road was
        littered with a surprising amount of garbage, abandoned
        autos and a veritable holocaust of flattened kitties. It
        wound and buckled its way through ugly concrete villages
        and along polluted beaches. We hadn&#146;t gone very far
        before Fred proclaimed Greece, &quot;the Mexico of
        Europe&quot;, a very astute observation.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The further we got from
        Patras, the prettier (and hillier) the landscape became,
        and the stronger the wind blew. Every kilometer felt like
        ten, making it next to impossible to enjoy the scenery.
        As the sun sank appreciably lower in the sky, Fred and I
        both started whining for lodgings to appear. When the
        first sign indicating &quot;Zimmer/Rooms/Chambres&quot;
        finally materialized we issued a huge sigh of relief and
        threw ourselves at the mercy of the wizened man sweeping
        beneath it. Somehow I still mustered the energy to
        bargain him down in price (it has become a reflex after
        so many months on the road, and usually works, though in
        this case we would have paid twice what he was asking)
        before he showed us the way to a funny little cluster of
        bungalows that was to be our home for the night. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Dinner in a bare-bones
        taverna was delicious. We noted that all the other
        customers were men and wondered how the village women
        spent their evenings. Walking home with full bellies in
        the total darkness, we mused that while traditional
        culture can be colorful, it&#146;s not a place we&#146;d
        want to live. I also couldn&#146;t help but wonder how
        Sasha and Dani were faring on their first days on the
        roads of Greece, saying a little atheist prayer for them
        before falling into the arms of Morpheus. </font></p>

        <td><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>24 September, Kalmari
        to Athens, 127K (f)</b></font><p><font size="2" face="Arial">My vision that all Greeks would be
        fun-loving, folk dancing, plate-smashing, smiling and
        happy was dissolved since quickly after our arrival here.
        Having made this realization, it came as no great
        surprise that our quest for a morning cup of coffee was
        so complicated today. After trying a few restaurants we
        came up with nothing. Even in a place that was marked as
        a café, using Andy&#146;s best Greek and putting on our
        warmest countenances we were greeted with shock when we
        asked for a cup. The little trendoid girl with her
        bleached-blond hair, oh-so-tight jeans and giggly bare
        midriff was too confused by the idea. &quot;Oh, English
        want coffee, Greek coffee? French coffee?&quot; she said.
        &quot;Yes! French coffee, please!&quot; we responded.
        &quot;We no have French coffee, sorry,&quot; she declared
        happily. Sometime later the mother appeared with Turkish
        coffee in hand. It tasted like dirt and metal but had
        caffeine in it.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Finally having the energy
        to continue, we rode along the Corinthian coast. It was
        harvest time in the vineyards. While riding we watched
        scruffy young country boys harvesting grapes. They
        brought the crates of freshly picked fruit to horsecarts
        powered by little tractors that resembled mechanized
        versions of their organic ancestor.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The lasting memory of the
        day would be that of the sound of autos whizzing by
        closely at dizzying speeds. Thankfully the wind that had
        pestered us throughout the day before had subsided. We
        traversed the disgusting new city of Corinth before
        crossing over the dramatic yet useless canal that joins
        the Bay of Corinth and Saronic gulf. (OK, it is not
        completely worthless; you could get a dingy through it
        and it does make a nice photo) Soon there were fewer
        towns and houses and our climb up the coastal cliffs on
        the way to Athens afforded us vistas over the Saronic
        gulf that were pretty, but no match for the Dalmatian
        coast. The major hindrance to my appreciation of the view
        was the carpet of trash that extended from the roadside
        to the sea and the chunks of debris floating in the
        water. This may have been the cradle of Western
        Civilization, but today&#146;s Greeks have yet to learn
        to use a trash can.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">We had two goals in mind
        when we hit the town of Megara: souvlaki and a train.
        Hungry from the challenging ride and not relishing the
        idea of riding in Athens we looked for both. I waited
        with the bikes while Andy went in search of the rail
        schedule. There would be no leaving our cycles to
        themselves for three hours while we went sightseeing in
        this burg. While waiting I watched herds of gypsy kids
        eye our bikes in awe, contemplating what they&#146;d be
        worth in an Athens pawn shop. Strike one, no trains until
        six or so and it was only two. Strike two, no munchies to
        be had; so we were off to Athens.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The one consolation was
        that Andy crafted a clever route into town. We&#146;d be
        able to skip much of the suburban traffic and rely on our
        second favorite form of transportation that begins with a
        &quot;B&quot; (a boat). We whizzed down to the seaside,
        hopped on a ferry to a little island off the coast, rode
        the length of the island and ferried into port. The only
        bummer of the whole affair was when I fell over at the
        ferry ticket stand in front of the hoards of passengers.
        Fortunately it was more embarrassing than painful. No
        Greek day is complete without a drama, and we saw one
        getting onto the boat to Athens. A military truck rushed
        to be the first on the ferry and then would not back up
        to clear the ramp so other cars could get on. The
        captain, his crew and the ten soldiers in the truck began
        to verbally abuse each other for fifteen minutes while
        all the passengers looked on. Finally the truck was
        shooed off the boat, the ramp drawn and we were off
        again.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Our general experiences
        with Athenians would be foreshadowed by the behavior of
        the drivers exiting the ferry. Long before we&#146;d
        docked all cars and trucks had started and began to
        jockey for position exiting the boat. Before coming to a
        rest near the ramp many had cut others off driving the
        few scant feet. Several others were hurling insults at
        one another most insinuating the professional nature of
        their mother&#146;s sexual exploits.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">We waited for the dust to
        clear and the revving traffic to exit before making our
        retreat. The Brats were now at the peril of being struck
        by the oncoming traffic trying to board the boat who had
        waited a millisecond to let the cars clear before
        boarding. This scene gives one an idea of warmth and
        patience of Athenians. The remainder of our trip into
        central Athens is lost in a gray haze for me. I put
        myself in a trance so I could forget the automotive
        atrocities that would no doubt occur. What I do remember
        was a constant flow of honking traffic, a stop at the
        tomb of the unknown soldier (really ridiculous uniforms
        on the sentries!), and settling in at our seedy hotel
        near Omonia Square.</font></p>

        for an &quot;I (heart) Athens&quot; bumper sticker.
        Compounding our distaste for the city, its smog, traffic,
        mean people and rude taxi drivers were the cold
        temperatures and rainy weather. Luckily Andy&#146;s
        childhood (and current) friend Peter Demopolous is Greek,
        so he had been here several times and knew the city well.
        Even more fortunate, Peter&#146;s mom, Popie, was there
        and was willing to store our bikes while we drove around
        in Turkey.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Mentioning that we were on
        our way to Turkey never seemed a good idea. The
        hostilities between the two over Cyprus were at a high
        point while we were there. I still find their mutual
        animosities hard to follow. They look the same. They eat
        nearly the same food. The women in the countryside cover
        most of their bodies and faces in both countries. And,
        their music sounds quite similar to the untrained ear.
        Still every time we said we were going we heard nearly
        the same response, &quot;Why you go to Turkey?&quot;
        &quot;The people are bad, it is dirty, you will be
        robbed&#133;.&quot; Strangely, when pressed, none of
        these Greeks had been to Turkey and most had never met or
        known a Turk. The propaganda machine seems well oiled in
        Greece.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">There were a few high
        points during our stay in the capital of Greece. First,
        Andy was more than satisfied with the availability of
        good coffee. Next, we discovered an amazing little
        restaurant and deli called, imaginatively, &quot;The Food
        Company.&quot; It was extraordinary for the fact it was a
        little slice of America in Greece. Barbara Hey of
        Minneapolis had married a Greek, moved to Athens and
        opened up simply the best eating establishment around. It
        was whacky, the help smiled, the food was great and for a
        moment we felt like we were at home. (Their cheesecake
        and carrot cake are unrivaled throughout the world!)</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">There were even a few
        memorable Greek things in Athens. The Archeological
        Museum is mind blowing. They are only able to display a
        small percentage of the artifacts they have, but what is
        on display is truly exceptional. The treasures from the
        burial chambers of Mycanae including the golden death
        masques and jewelry left me awestruck and the galleries
        of sculpture defy description. The only problem is that
        you have to go to Athens to see it.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">When we returned to Athens
        from Turkey in order to continue our journey three weeks
        later, the city seemed to take revenge on our distaste
        for it. The weather was still worse than our first visit.
        (I&#146;d actually passed through Athens on my way to
        Mykonos and refused to leave the airport though I had a
        lengthy stopover.) The storms were so strong that the
        port was closed and we were unable to get a boat to
        Rhodes. Our extra day there seemed like hell. We saw two
        movies to pass the time, (both worse than Athens itself)
        &quot;Men in Black&quot; and &quot;Faceoff&quot;. We, of
        course, made a little detour to our favorite slice of
        America, the Food Company.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The one strategic error
        made in our exodus from Athens was not taking our bikes
        from Popie&#146;s to the Pireas, Athens&#146; port, when
        we first learned our boat would not sail. Had we done
        that we&#146;d have been there waiting for the first boat
        to leave. We&#146;d been given the maritime schedule by
        the Greek National Tourist Office which clearly stated
        that our boat would leave at five in the evening.
        Consequently we took our time in the morning, had a
        leisurely breakfast, only calling the ferry company to
        find the status of the boat at ten-thirty that morning.
        The news they relayed was disturbing. Previous days
        storms had put most boats off schedule, ours to Rhodes
        would leave at one this afternoon. PANIC! Our bikes were
        still a half-hour out of town at Popie&#146;s and from
        there an hour-and-a-half ride to the port under the best
        circumstances.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">We called Popie and asked
        her to find out the train schedule to the port while we
        hopped in a cab for her place. Our cabby was the only
        calm one in Greece. He drove us at a nearly comatose pace
        across town, engaging in the annoying Greek taxi driver
        habit of stopping for every person hailing a cab and
        asking where they were going. This way they can double up
        on fares as well as driving time for time-pressed
        passengers like us. (I can&#146;t wait to see how
        international tourists from places like New York and
        Paris react to this practice during the 2004
        Olympics&#133;.) </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">More distressing news
        greeted us at Popie&#146;s. The train would not leave
        until three in the afternoon. Left with few options we
        began to pack our bikes with the intent to ride to
        Pireas. I figured if we can&#146;t make the boat, at
        least we&#146;ll be there for the next. Athens had not
        grown on me no matter how good the carrot cake was.
        Popie&#146;s cabinet maker called a friend with a truck
        and asked him if he&#146;d consider giving us a ride to
        Pireas. He would but he demanded 25,000 agoutis, or
        nearly one hundred dollars! We were upset about the
        price, and bargained him down to 20,000, but only on the
        condition he could get to us immediately and have us at
        the dock by our departure time. We packed while waiting
        for the driver who took his time getting to us. He
        finally arrived in a massive Mercedes moving van at noon
        leaving only an hour to make it to the port. Even the
        driver seemed nervous about making the boat given the
        perpetual nature of Athens&#146; traffic. We threw our
        bikes in the back, hopped in the cab and were off. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Our driver had no
        knowledge of the passenger port and kept quizzing us on
        the location of the dock in Greek over and over. We took
        this as a bad sign and thought it would be his excuse for
        not getting us on time. He got us to Pireas at the
        expense of our nerves, hurling his truck around corners
        and through lane changes like Lady Di and Dodi&#146;s
        chauffeur (it must be a Mercedes thing). Unfortunately he
        took us to the commercial and container part of the port
        and stranded us in traffic. We had to get out and ride
        the last kilometers in order to make it. The driver
        literally tossed a bike to me, nearly knocking me down
        and tearing my pants. Too shocked by the action and
        thankful I wasn&#146;t harmed to make a fuss about it. We
        wove through cars parked in the street and found
        ourselves at the enormously confusing port. No one seemed
        to know where the boat to Rhodes was docked, but everyone
        was willing to give erroneous advice. We were literally
        the last on the boat watching the crew hoist the door as
        we locked our bikes and went to the deck to bid good
        riddance to fair Athens for now. </font></p>

        <td><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>22 October, Rhodes to
        Lardos, 107km (a)</b></font><p><font size="2" face="Arial">It was pouring rain when we arrived in
        Rhodes. We sought shelter under an overhang on the
        gritty, water-covered docks until it subsided a little.
        Fred wanted to change into biking clothes there, which
        seemed pretty pointless to me since we clearly
        weren&#146;t going to ride that day. Besides, a handful
        of other people waiting with us made changing indiscreet
        at best, and I was especially anxious to get away from a
        large and ripe pile of dog feces that risked being
        stepped in or rolled through. When the rain let up after
        a little while, we made a break for the old walled town,
        only a few hundred meters away. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">More rain, as well as
        confusing road signs, slowed our way to our very basic
        accommodation, where we stripped our bikes before heading
        back outside for a walk around town in our geeky rain
        outfits. Neither of us had any energy, yet felled
        compelled to play tourist for the day. And it must be
        admitted that Rhodes does contain some awesome sights.
        Our first stop, the town aquarium, was not one of them
        however. We liked the groovy deco design of the building,
        and the mosaic-y floors and grotto-like setting inside,
        but beyond that the place was pretty much of a yawn. More
        interesting were the famous old harbor once bestridden by
        the Colossus (its entrance now more tastefully marked by
        a pair of bronze deer), the chunk-filled archeology
        museum, and the castle of the Knights of St. John. This
        last contained a seemingly infinite number of exquisite
        reception rooms, each with a perfectly restored mosaic
        floor taken from an ancient palace on the nearby island
        of Kos. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The next day we were
        relieved to wake up with the sun shining. At breakfast we
        eavesdropped on our neighbors, all of them elderly
        Britannics on an ultra-low-budget package tour. Fred
        caught one of them secreting cheese from the buffet into
        a zip-lock bag, which caused us to suspect that lunch
        wasn&#146;t included in the price of their holiday. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">By nine we were already on
        the road, pedaling in earnest for the first time in
        nearly a month. It felt glorious, even on the
        heavily-trafficked road that led us out of town and past
        several nightmarish &quot;villages&quot; of cheesy
        tourist accommodation. After we passed the airport we had
        the road virtually to ourselves, though. It hugged the
        coast for many miles, past goat-filled pastures and
        garbage-strewn beaches, before making an abrupt turn
        towards the heavens. I suffered the first of a string of
        flats here before pumping up to a place called Kritinia
        for lunch. At five hundred meters, the air was noticeably
        cooler and the view of the sea below was breathtaking.
        Unfortunately, our lunch didn&#146;t stand up to its
        surroundings. The souvlaki tasted like it might have been
        made from rat meat. I fed my entire portion to a very
        happy cat while Fred somehow managed to ingest his.
        Adding insult to injury, our mustached hostess demanded
        an exorbitant amount of drachmas, possibly in
        anticipation of the upcoming touristic dry spell. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The remainder of the
        afternoon was spent on a brutal roller-coaster through
        piney forests, followed by a juicy twenty-kilometer
        descent into the sleepy village of Apolakia, in the
        center of the island. Against our desperate hopes of a
        level route to the opposite coast, our Rhodes road
        climbed over an obscenely steep two-hundred meter ridge,
        before dropping us gently down to the beach. This part of
        the ride was sublime, with the pale sun lowering itself
        towards the sea in front of us and no need to pedal. Best
        of all, the utter lack of evil autos allowed us to ride
        side-by-side and chat for a change.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The room-hunting process
        was trickier than usual, since every place we stopped was
        either closed for the season or in the process of being
        closed. We ended up in a tacky beach-side mega-resort
        overrun by Germans. At dinner our waiters expressed frank
        astonishment when they learned we weren&#146;t from
        Baden-Baden. After consuming more food than most people
        would consider humanly possible, we rolled off to bed,
        our legs aching and our heads filled with hopes that the
        next day would bring good weather for the continuation of
        our <i>tour de Rhodes</i>. </font></p>

        <td><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>23 October, Lardos to
        Rhodes, 60km (f)</b></font><p><font size="2" face="Arial">We
        awoke to the patter of a heavy rain falling, flashes
        lightning striking and claps of thunder. Not an ideal
        BikeBrats riding day. Mary, the very patient desk clerk
        was extremely pessimistic about the weather and was
        already at work to try to find us a taxi into Rhodes as
        we passed the front desk of our hotel on the way to
        breakfast. Breakfast could have been in Frankfurt,
        Dusseldorf, Munich or any German city, since we seemed to
        be the only English speakers there and were a novelty for
        the waiters and waitresses who were anxious to see the
        end of the season. Mary seemed more than disappointed
        when we declined the conveyance to town opting to take
        advantage of the momentary clearing in the sky. A
        decision we were to live to regret later. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The first half of the trip
        back to Rhodes City passed without incident. The
        uncrowded seaside road afforded us lovely coastal views
        blanketed by clouds. After making it half way we stopped
        at a market for a snack. Availability of fish roe in a
        tube at the market served as evidence of the Nordic
        tourist population in the high season. While munching
        crackers and roe we watched thunderheads form over the
        water and move inland. We mounted our bikes in the light
        drizzle and watched the thermometer drop, seemingly
        reliving our Swedish experience.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">I don&#146;t know what it
        was exactly, but something in my bones detected that it
        was about to pour. I noticed an abandoned shop with a
        large patio when I sensed the rain and we ducked into it.
        Five minutes later cats, dogs and buckets were falling
        from the sky. Wind, rain and hail pummeled the island.
        The road and shoulder became a river. A few losing games
        of backgammon to Andy (and vowing never to play him
        again) and over an hour later the rain was still falling.
        We set times that we would go, regardless of the rain and
        watched those goals come and go without moving. Feebly we
        tried to flag down a truck to get a ride to town without
        success. Getting drenched in the downpour added injury to
        insult.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Finally a little red
        pickup truck with two cute Greek boys stopped. Andy ran
        to ask them for a ride only to discover they&#146;d
        stopped not for us but because their truck was not
        functioning. We battened down our hatches and rode a few
        hundred meters to a café in order to find a taxi. There
        was none to be found on the island. The rain put them in
        demand and none wanted to come 25K to pick up a couple of
        soggy cyclists.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Calling the shipping line
        to find out if our boat was on time provided no comfort.
        The woman at the office told Andrew that the boat would
        arrive and depart immediately, leaving as much as an hour
        early. We were over an hour from port, which meant that
        the boat would leave before we could get there if Irene
        from Salamis Lines was correct. I called her back and
        tried to find out more. She told me that in fact the boat
        had not yet arrived. She reiterated that we must try to
        get to the boat or risk losing our money on our fare, and
        that she still didn&#146;t know when it would depart. To
        complicate matters it was still raining. Before getting
        on bikes once again we contemplated what we would do if
        there was no boat. Plans ranged from retreating back to
        the US to crying.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">This was clearly not the
        average rainfall in Rhodes. Raging torrents washed
        underneath bridges, leaving us wondering if they would
        wash them away as we crossed. Water stood on the roads
        and had damaged roadworks projects in progress, providing
        us many obstacles as we rode. Riding as fast as we still
        found ourselves looking down on the harbor some 20
        minutes late for our boat. From above we could see one
        boat docked and another attempting to land in rough seas.
        When we reached the harbor we watched the drama of the
        Nissos Kypros unfold. A line had broken as they tried to
        dock and now the boat was pinned by the wind and waves
        against the dock denting the sides of the boat and
        breaking pieces of asphalt off the pier. In order to dock
        properly it had to come around 90 degrees, putting its
        stern and ramp against the pier. Passengers on the boat
        looked on with horror, listening to metal grind against
        pavement.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Luckily the other ferry
        left port and joined a tugboat in helping to right our
        boat. The crew was frantic to have everyone board
        quickly. Ten of them stood shouting sometimes conflicting
        orders to passengers and vehicles boarding. We boarded
        only to find that we needed to have our passports stamped
        at the foot of the pier before we could leave with the
        boat. We raced there and back making it in plenty of
        time. The crew was still trying to find places for the
        last vehicles as we rolled up the ramp. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">There a cast of characters
        on the boat fitting of a circus or sitcom. Just after
        locking our bikes in the hold I bumped into a
        sarong-wearing, bongo-playing and patchouli-oil-soaked
        hippie on his way to his love van. Another passenger, an
        aging paranoid stricken Britannic bloke, warned us about
        leaving anything on the bikes. He claimed that he&#146;d
        had something stolen out of his camper the last time on
        the Nissos Kypros, and with &quot;all these beatniks on
        board who knows what might turn up missing.&quot; He
        continued, &quot;you know, how else can they finance
        their travels except by stealing.&quot; </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The one thing that many
        would have in common regardless of their place on the
        social ladder would be sea sickness. The storms had the
        seas churning and the wind blowing. In the dining room
        the wind wasn&#146;t the only thing blowing. More than
        one person made a hasty retreat from their table grabbing
        barf receptacles that looked like Chinese food take-out
        (take-away if you are from Britain) containers. I found
        myself just short of nabbing one and giving up my dinner.
        The lighting in the dining room was no help. Harsh
        fluorescent bulbs rendered everyone&#146;s face a sickly
        blue-green that made even the most sound-of-stomach look
        pre-vomitous. Luckily I was so tired from our rain-swept
        ride that I hit the pillow snoring, though Andy reported
        difficulties getting to sleep due to the violent pitching
        of the craft.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Worth mentioning is the
        hassle we had with the Nissos Kypros staff. Obviously
        still rattled by the dangerous docking, they treated us
        to their worst face upon boarding. The left hand
        didn&#146;t know what the right was doing. One staff
        person demanded our immigration cards, the next our
        passports and the third, unaware of the actions of the
        others was surprised to find we had neither in our
        possession when we got to him. After finally receiving a
        cabin assignment from the disoriented staff we descended
        into the bowels of the ship through diesel fumed
        corridors. Their we found that our hideously cramped
        cabin was substantially less than we&#146;d been
        promised. The ships purser claimed that we&#146;d been
        given what we paid for. Andy found the ship&#146;s
        brochure describing the classes of service and I was left
        to argue to get another cabin in the right class. We kept
        the key to the original cabin to pay them back for our
        trouble and gave it to a passenger who had booked deck
        passage. John, who had come to Cyprus for only two days
        in order to see the green line saved the key for his
        return trip to Rhodes.</font></p>
