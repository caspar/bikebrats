        <td width="358"><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>18 June,
        arriving in Laos, 28km (f)</b><p>Frankly I was a little
        bit nervous to leave our last bastion of western
        influenced civilization. Two factors left me
        uncomfortable. First, though it had made considerable
        improvement, was the condition of my right eye. The
        swelling was down substantially but there are still two
        itchy little lumps in the upper lid. And, second, I still
        hadn&#146;t found new spokes for the broken and damaged
        ones in the rear wheel. I don&#146;t know if I&#146;ll be
        able to trust Laotian eye and bike doctors, we will
        see&#133;</p>
        <p>In advance of our departure we didn&#146;t manage to
        leave our elegant $20/night Thai hotel until well after
        the standard checkout time. And although I'd cleared our
        late checkout with the front desk everyone in the
        housekeeping staff had come by to find out if we were
        ready to leave every few minutes after noon. Something
        told me that they were ready to be rid of the BikeBrats.
        We started to wonder what hotels think of us, especially
        the ones that house us as we frenetically put together
        our website. On those days we usually lock ourselves in
        the room for two nights and a day or more, ordering room
        service. The maids usually have to fight their way in to
        clean the room while we type away and bicker over which
        pictures to include. God forbid one should stumble in
        while I have the telephone in a hundred pieces while I
        try to connect to our ISP.</p>
        <p>We finally loaded up the bikes and got on the road
        about 2:30, plenty of time to ride 24k, cross the border,
        find a hotel and meet our friend Ly and her sister
        Caroline. After just a few cranks we reached the Thai
        border. There seemed to be a general confusion as to
        where bikes should go to exit Thailand. We were pointed
        in one direction and then the other until we finally
        found a booth with no on inside. A bored looking Thai-guy
        in uniform finally shuffled over, stamped our passports
        and waved us through. Just as we were about to pedal off
        another complication arose. This time a non-uniformed
        customs officer raced up and said &quot;bridge not for
        recreation like bike.&quot; We looked at one another and
        back at him and told him this wasn&#146;t recreation,
        this is transportation and started off. More insistent
        this time and with the back up of a small army of
        uniformed and non-uniformed border officials, he told us
        that we must take the bus. We&#146;d have to exit the
        border, cross into Thailand, go to the bus station, buy a
        ticket, load the bikes, cross the border on the Thailand
        side and ride over the &quot;Friendship Bridge&quot; on
        the bus to Laos. This sounded too inconvenient to us so
        we paid the next bus driver a bribe, loaded the bikes on
        his bus at the border crossing and boarded the sweltering
        tin can for our ride to Laos.</p>
        <p>Upon reaching the Laos border crossing we wondered why
        we had needed to get a visa in Bangkok. There, at the
        border, plain as day, was a sign that said &quot;Visa at
        Border&quot;, next time we&#146;ll know. Before we knew
        it we were in Laos and I was mugging for the camera in
        front of the &quot;Welcome to Laos&quot; sign that looked
        as though it had seen better days. The Laotian border
        guard had a chuckle when I demonstrated that there were
        huge holes in the sign by putting my arm through it. We
        were a little surprised at the lack of activity on both
        sides of the boundary. This was, after all, the primary
        land entry point to a nation. There were only about ten
        people crossing over at the same time as us and there was
        virtually no traffic on the Laotian side.</p>
        <p>As we rode towards the Laotian capital people waved
        and smiled seemingly more ingenuously than in Thailand.
        There were a number of immediate differences between here
        and our last destination. First of all the traffic seemed
        to move like a very viscous liquid slowly and steadily
        towards its objective, oozing around obstructions and
        never in a hurry. Another subtle change was in the text
        of the signs for businesses (and there were very few
        until we reached the city limits); all had English and
        Laotian --unlike in Thailand where Thai was king and
        queen. Perhaps an even more important cultural indicator
        was that the stores sold Pepsi almost exclusively whereas
        in Thailand Coke ruled the fizzy soft drink market. Was
        the owner of the Pepsi bottling company in Las a party
        member?</p>
        <p>The streets got progressively more busy as we reached
        the center of Vientiane. Complicating matters further,
        paving was still just a concept on many of the downtown
        avenues. Still there wasn&#146;t enough activity to evoke
        the image of a capital city. What few vehicles there were
        traversing the city were moving at speeds that betrayed
        the hour. It was five in the afternoon on a Monday.
        Before long we&#146;d negotiated a room for the night and
        were ready to set off to meet our friends. While I was
        waiting for Andy to check out one of the potential hotels
        I sat on the street and watched naked little kids play in
        mud puddles across the street. Imagine that in Paris,
        Washington or any other capital city in the central
        business district?</p>
        <p>We&#146;d set a rendezvous for 6:00 in the swankest
        hotel in town, the Westin-equivalent-unit of Vientiane,
        the Lao Plaza. As we waited in the cavernous, elegant
        (compared to our modest digs) and empty lobby Andy sipped
        a Mai-Tai and I slurped an ice cream sundae. We grew a
        little worried as the time passed and it was suddenly
        well after six. Andy and I both knew Ly to be especially
        prompt so we were more than concerned as the clock ticked
        on to thirty past. Just as we were about to give up, Ly
        and her sister Caroline arrived and all was well. </p>
        <p>Our first priority became dinner and we sought an
        appropriate place to sate Andy&#146;s hunger (he
        hadn&#146;t eaten anything all day). I wasn&#146;t so
        hungry, my stomach was just settling down after a few
        days of twitchiness. Caroline was suffering from the
        same, so we were a little overwhelmed when Andy ordered
        one of everything from the menu. At the end of the meal
        there was more left on the plates than we had eaten and
        the bill was a whopping 36,000 agoutis (nearly ten
        dollars). After dinner we decided that drinks were in
        order so we adjourned to the cocktail lounge and
        restaurant of the nearby commie Lane Xiang hotel. In a
        rattan-lined dining room a cheesy Lao lounge act
        performed traditional dance and music. There were two
        dancing couples in Laotian drag and we had difficulty
        distinguishing the boys from the girls for their attire
        and movements. After the show one of the band members
        began to croon in accompaniment of the orchestra. The
        rotund leader beckoned for some audience participation
        and a Japanese man headed for the stage to sing a number.
        He nearly fell over on the way to the stage, tripping
        over everything in his path before belting out a rather
        blurry tune. A Chinese man was the next victim, but he
        had stage presence and talent and closed to a hearty
        round of applause. The mistress of ceremonies kept him on
        stage and the two entertained the largely Asian crowd as
        though the Sonny and Cher of Laos. Soon we were all ready
        to call it a day and head for our respective beds.</font></p>

        <td width="395"><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>19 June,
        getting to Luang Prabang (f)</b><p>The next day we rose
        early and met the girls for breakfast. We ate in a
        restaurant where the waitress had yet to take her course
        in breakfast. Even the simplest request or concept seemed
        to elude her, like coffee being a beverage one might
        consume. Somehow we finished our morning meal and went to
        find airplane tickets for our flight north. It was a
        shockingly simple task and soon we and the girls parted
        ways to take care of our respective errands. Ours brought
        us to the Chinese Consulate to get our visas. It seemed
        like a simple task, and it was until I said the forbidden
        word, &quot;bike&quot;. Andy had forgotten to coach me
        against using that word in the presence of Chinese
        officials.</p>
        <p>It was with that mention that the conversation
        suddenly shifted. &quot;Let me give you some
        advice,&quot; said the Chinese bureaucrat in a tone that
        expressed that this was not a recommendation that could
        be refused. &quot;You cannot travel in China the way you
        would in any other country. Independent travel is not
        looked upon favorably, though a bicycle is better than a
        car or motorcycle.&quot; I felt the hair bristle on the
        back of my neck, I wasn&#146;t to be told what I could
        and couldn&#146;t do. Just as I was about to lash out I
        felt a wave of Laotian serenity come about me and I said,
        &quot;Well, if we can&#146;t cycle town to town
        we&#146;ll train or bus, is that o.k.?&quot; He smiled
        and shook his head, &quot;yes.&quot; I caught Andy
        swallowing his heart out of the corner of my eye The
        first Chinese travel crisis had been averted.</p>
        <p>Despite his outburst, this was a pretty cool consulate
        worker by any standard. We didn&#146;t have our passport
        photos with us, but he was willing to process the
        application regardless. We just had to promise to bring
        them with us when we returned from Luang Prabang. Soon we
        were on our way to the airport to fly north, stopping at
        a few temples along the way. We thought we had tons of
        time and would have had a disaster not occurred. It never
        struck any of us that we&#146;d need our passports to
        travel within Laos. It seemed to us that a copy and the
        receipt from the Chinese </p>
        <p>Consul would do in any situation until we reached
        domestic passport control at the airport. Our copies
        wouldn&#146;t do, nor would any other identification.
        Andy and Ly raced back to the Chinese Consul while
        Caroline and I waited. I decided to teach her backgammon
        in order to avoid looking at my watch the entire time.
        The minutes passed quickly, and before I knew it the hour
        was 3:27, just three minutes before our flight when the
        two returned with our travel documents. Just in time to
        make the flight. Rushing out to board the flight, Andy
        and Ly told tale of banging on the gate of the closed
        embassy and begging and pleading for them to find the
        passports.</p>
        <p>It is really a joy to travel with Ly, especially in
        her country of origin. Everywhere we go she has contacts
        through her travel agency and everything seems to always
        work out. We had one bad moment in the Luang Prabang
        airport. The Police began to insist that Caroline was a
        Laotian despite her French Passport and she would have to
        go with the police to register in town. Ly confidently
        told them that she was French and that we&#146;d have the
        passport sent to the police in town and that by no means
        would there be any difference in plan. I like her
        forcefulness and ability to make her way happen.</font></p>

        <td width="358"><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>19-23
        June, Luang Prabang (f)</b><p>We started our hectic
        tourist activities within just a few moments of arriving.
        Leaving our hotel we walked down the main street of Luang
        Prabang. The last few hundred meters of the street served
        as the &quot;night market&quot; where you can purchase
        foodstuffs. We stopped and grazed on our way to the side
        of the Mekong. Munching on a grilled chicken and little
        rice and coconut cakes we descended the riverbank and
        walked down to the water. As the afternoon progressed to
        early evening the vast brown waters become the bathing
        spot for riverside dwellers. Kids the same color as the
        Mekong splashed, washed and did dangerous acrobatic
        tricks in the shallow water.</p>
        <p>A restaurant up the bank suspended on stilts seemed
        like the right place to spend the sunset hour with drinks
        and dinner. The sky turned from gray to pink and the
        mosquitoes began to bite. The pace of our off-the-bikes
        vacation had been set. Strolling down the Champs Elysees
        of Luang Prabang we were taken by how our meter matched
        that of the city. Here it seemed sleepy even when
        compared to the comatose capital of Laos we&#146;d left
        behind.</p>
        <p>On our way to find dessert we spotted a shop renting
        bikes. Not able to spend a few days of vacation off the
        bikes, we secured four beauties for our stay. It came at
        a dear cost, nearly three dollars for five days each.
        Andy and I got big black Chinese numbers with spring
        mounted leather seats and brakes operated by metal bars
        like old Dutch bikes. Our handlebar baskets came adorned
        with the Playboy logo made us feel somehow macho while
        the girls&#146; flower-seated jobs had a cutesy
        floppy-eared bunny on their bags. The shop operator was
        frightfully skinny. He looked like a brown leather sack
        of bones and his eyes had the glazed and distant look of
        someone whacked on opium. </p>
        <p>We immediately tested out our new wheels by taking a
        ride down the main street of town past lounging Laotians,
        monks, wats and occidental tourists and ex-pats. After a
        drink on the terrace of a place that advertised ice cream
        but had none we glided back to the hotel on our shiny new
        black bikes. I couldn&#146;t help but wonder if Siegfried
        (my bike) would be jealous of my newfound affection for
        another.</p>
        <p>The next day we arose at what we thought was an early
        hour. Ly had been up for hours and had taken a city tour
        on her bike just after dawn. She&#146;d found a morning
        agenda for us and we&#146;d be heading off to a Hmong
        village after breakfast and the museum. The museum was
        housed in the former residence of the king and queen of
        Laos. The grand home is furnished in much the same way as
        it was when they occupied it. Grand public rooms have
        marvelous paintings and weavings on the walls. The finest
        hall in the house is the throne room. There red lacquer
        walls are studded with Japanese colored mirrors broken
        and formed into a glorious mosaic that tells the story of
        Laos --which included a shocking number of beheadings and
        battles. The sleeping quarters of the Royal family were
        surprisingly austere. They did not live in the grand
        style of the public part of the house. Legend has it that
        the last heirs to the throne died un-crowned. They were
        held prisoners in a cave and died of starvation and lack
        of medical attention during the dark early days of the
        communists.</p>
        <p>Next we felt our way towards the Hmong village,
        stopping to ask directions every few hundred meters. We
        were ushered to a big covered market sporting the
        textiles of the area. We saw weavings of every sort,
        ranging from the finest silks to the crudest woolens and
        cottons. There were fifty some-odd vendors all competing
        for our eight eyes and meager souvenir budgets. Despite
        our limited funds each of us left with a bag full of
        goodies.</p>
        <p>After shopping, our wallets empty, we headed for the
        village and walked through it. The houses, all wood and
        mounted on stilts, seemed very prosperous. Apparently
        more shoppers like us had made it out here from Luang
        Prabang. The village was well off enough to sport a
        pretty impressive wat and the requisite set of monks
        attending to it. Just as we were about to loop back to
        the bikes and head to town for lunch we spotted some sort
        of a community event. Most of the village had converged
        on a riverside house and a huge feast was being laid out
        on tables under a tent in the yard. Just as we were
        asking what was going on we were whisked into the
        gathering, escorted upstairs into a house on stilts and
        seated in a room full of elders. It was only there that
        we understood that we were to be witness to a Buddhist
        wedding.</p>
        <p>I felt, well, like an uninvited guest at a marriage.
        Not because the folks weren&#146;t welcoming, just
        because it seemed that they hadn&#146;t expected any
        foreigners (<i>falangs</i>) at the event. Still we sat
        next to the wall on our feet, being careful not to point
        them at anyone (for that is a grave insult) and we were
        served cool glasses of water. A little low-lying table
        covered with two flower arrangements/offerings stood in
        the center of the room filled with the aged of the
        village. People grinned and nodded at us and they
        pantomimed for us how to make an offering to the happy
        couple with flowers and kip notes. Someone found the one
        person in the village who spoke a little English and sat
        them next to us. He explained a little more about the
        coming ceremony. I became restless and a little
        uncomfortable about crashing the wedding and convinced
        the others we should head to Luang Prabang for lunch. We
        got up to leave, making a last offering on the way to the
        door before the room stopped and all but tackled us
        imploring us to stay and have our wrists bound.</p>
        <p>We sat back down in the back of the room and more
        people began to stream in. Soon a cleric arrived and sat
        behind the altar of flowers. The groom (whom Andrew
        surmised must be rich, because he wasn&#146;t attractive)
        and exquisitely lovely bride followed along with their
        respective families. At this point the room was becoming
        crowded and they could have used the space we were
        occupying. Still everyone seemed almost as fascinated by
        us as by the wedding. One interesting question that
        everyone asked is whether Andy, Ly, Caroline and I were
        couples and if we were married.</p>
        <p>This confirmed my assumption that everyone assumed
        that we were two &quot;whities&quot; on vacation in Laos
        and had picked up a couple of trophy brides. Further
        reinforcing my theory was the rather lengthy lecture I
        received from the man next to me about the difficulties
        for a European to marry a Laotian and the permits and
        approvals that must be obtained. Andy and I had seen our
        share of ugly old Germans (and others) with hot Thai
        babes in Thailand and had expressed disgust at the
        practice. We&#146;d also wondered if it wasn&#146;t in
        some ways good for the Thai? Whatever the case I
        wasn&#146;t ready to be lumped into that category and we
        explained that we were but friends.</p>
        <p>The ceremony itself was a simple and short affair
        divided into four logical parts. First, is the request
        for the permission from the parents for the marriage.
        Next a villager reads the local administration&#146;s
        formal permit for the wedding. Next the monk/cleric
        chants the ceremony that culminates in the two being
        joined by being tied together to form one. The ceremony
        closes with each wedding guest taking two pieces of
        string and tying one on each of the brides and grooms
        wrists while wishing them well. Finally the monk/cleric
        gives the happy couple advice on how to live well as a
        couple. (and, fifth, I dispute that this was really part
        of the wedding, the wedding guests tie strings to the
        wrists of the <i>falangs</i> so that they don&#146;t feel
        left out.)</p>
        <p>Following the marriage we walked downstairs and were
        asked to join in the celebration. We already felt like
        we&#146;d been treated to too much generosity and excused
        ourselves, but not before they insisted we each drink a
        glass of <i>Lao-lao,</i> the local rice alcohol.
        Afterwards we pedaled back to the village. My path back
        to Luang Prabang was less direct than the trip there. I
        felt the effects of that little glass of booze after
        having none for some four weeks.</p>
        <p>Our daily afternoon triathlon began. Lunching, napping
        and coffeeing were featured every day we stayed in the
        sleepy monk-ridden town. An afternoon excursion took us
        to a few of the dozen or-so <i>wats</i> in Luang Prabang.
        A one hundred-meter hill towers over the riverside town.
        On the top are a stupa and a view of the countryside. One
        surprise on the hill is the enormous machine gun that
        still remains there. It is not so shocking because of the
        gun but because it sits on a dangerous mechanism that
        allows it to turn rather quickly and violently and could
        easily crush a little kid or send him flying off the side
        of the hill.</p>
        <p>Our featured outing for the next day was a trip up the
        Mekong to see caves that house some four thousand images
        of the Buddha. We&#146;d met our captain the night before
        near a wat that featured mosaics like those in the royal
        palace. For but ten dollars he&#146;d take us two hours
        upriver and one hour back on his long-tailed boat.
        We&#146;d contemplated taking a speedboat but
        couldn&#146;t imagine an hour on the noisy and dangerous
        boats. Our boat turned out to be nearly as loud and
        probably just as uncomfortable. As the speedboats buzzed
        by, occupants wrapped in life preservers and heads
        encased in helmets, I figured we made the right decision.
        We were treated to a two-hour look at riverside life.
        Water buffalo (some of which were pink instead of gray
        making them look like enormous pigs) grazed the banks and
        wallowed in the mud, men fished, loads were hauled and,
        of course, people bathed and washed their clothes. It was
        Sunday, so our captain&#146;s young son joined us,
        spending most of the misty morning dozing on the back of
        the boat next to the droning motor.</p>
        <p>When we finally arrived at the tourist site we were
        besieged by little munchkins vending offerings for the
        Buddha images in the caves. It was hard to refuse them,
        and there were, after all, four thousand images to make
        offerings to. We bought nearly enough little bouquets,
        candles and sticks of incense to make an offering to
        every one of them.</p>
        <p>On the way back we stopped at two little Mekong-side
        villages. The first was truly a tourist trap. Each home
        had a little display case selling faux-antiques and other
        useless knick-knacks. Still Ly managed to find an antique
        portable opium scale and purchased it and we met the
        oldest monk we&#146;d ever seen, so all was not lost. The
        second village sported a pottery and brick making
        operation that was very large-scale. Here we saw the
        industry of Laos. Another afternoon triathlon followed
        seeing a few wats and meeting monks. We wondered why
        there were so many here?</p>
        <p>Our last day was sort of a bust. It involved a
        one-hour <i>tuk-tuk</i> ride over the roughest unpaved
        road you can imagine. I was so tired and jostled when we
        returned I&#146;d almost forgotten why we went. We&#146;d
        set out to see the waterfall some 27 kilometers from
        town. It was impressive. Huge umbrella shaped domes of
        calcified moss formed over grottos of ferns. Green water
        poured down the face of the falls and collected in great
        pools that would have been great for swimming had the
        temperature not been so cool due to the rain. We broke
        with tradition on our last afternoon. Following our
        riverside lunch we did errands and got our hair cut.
        There was no nap this afternoon for me, though Andy got a
        few moments rest while I wrote this passage.</p>
        <p>Perhaps the most exciting moment of the trip to Luang
        Prabang came as we boarded our flight back to Vientiane.
        We found our flight to be on the oldest and ugliest
        Chinese prop-plane you can imagine. Besides looking
        poorly maintained the cockpit was filthy. One Lao woman
        was so uncomfortable with the flight that left 30 minutes
        early she barfed during the entire time we were airborne.
        Our return to Vientiane reinforced how much busier the
        capital is than the town of Luang Prabang. We found
        ourselves put-off by the busyness and dirtiness in
        contrast to the quiet calm beauty of the countryside.</font></p>

        <td width="395"><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>25 June,
        Vientiane to Pakxan, 160 kilometers (a)</b><p>Route 13 is
        Laos&#146; main highway, running roughly parallel to the
        Mekong and linking virtually all of the country&#146;s
        main towns. Built by the French (and originally called
        &quot;Route Coloniale 13&quot;), it has been very
        recently upgraded (i.e. paved) by a Swedish concern and
        is considered by all to be by far and away the best road
        in the land. And at nearly any given time you could
        stretch out in the middle of this grand thoroughfare and
        have a nice long nap, undisturbed save for the occasional
        water buffalo mistaking you for a saltlick. The mere
        thought that we&#146;ll be spending three more days on
        this road as we make our way south to Savannakhet gives
        me goosebumps of pure joy.</p>
        <p>Our day and a half in the capital had passed pretty
        much without incident. After arrival we hired a cab to
        take us out to &quot;Buddha Park,&quot; thirty kilometers
        outside of town on the banks of the Mekong. A gift of
        Vientiane&#146;s Indian community, its huge concrete
        sculptures owe more to Hindu mythology than to any
        Buddhist teachings. Almost nightmarish in their
        garishness and hyper-abundance, these sculptures
        attracted our attention only long enough to snap off a
        few shots before loading back into the decrepit Toyota
        taxi. (&quot;Thirty-eight years old! Older than me!&quot;
        enthused our slightly whacky driver as we gingerly placed
        our feet on the vehicle&#146;s decaying floorboards.)</p>
        <p>Back in town we discovered the epicenter of the ex-pat
        community during a walk with Caroline &#150;the Fountain
        Square. Here we had iced coffee and Danish pastries in a
        sanitized, air-conditioned environment, surrounded by NGO
        workers of various stages of cynicism and crustiness.
        They pull up in their sparkling new Land Cruisers, nearly
        running the place down with them, have a cursory glance
        around the place and distribute schmooze selectively. As
        tourists, of course, we were completely invisible. </p>
        <p>Walking along the river in the fading light of the
        day, we came upon a raucous game of foot-volleyball (I
        don&#146;t know the actual name of the sport) being
        played on the premises of a particularly decrepit <i>wat</i>.
        The set up is essentially volleyballesque, except with a
        lower net and only three players to a team, each with a
        clearly defined role. After a successful foot-service,
        the wicker ball is carefully set up to the
        &quot;spiker&quot;, who hangs in the air upside-down as
        he kicks violently into the other team&#146;s court. The
        role of the third player (i.e. the non-serving,
        non-spiking one) is to block this final kick, also while
        upside-down. The quality of play here was high enough to
        attract a sizable crowd (among which Caroline was the
        only female not hawking snacks) and was nothing short of
        mesmerizing. We rushed back to get Ly so she could watch
        too. </p>
        <p>After a delicious meal at an Indian restaurant, we
        made our (temporary) farewells to the Phouthavy girls,
        who had an early bus to catch the next morning. It would
        feel odd negotiating Laos on our own after having our
        hands held for so long&#133;</p>
        <p>The next morning we successfully obtained our Chinese
        visas, paying only $20 extra to have it processed on the
        spot. I spent the afternoon at the pool of the Lao Plaza
        hotel, listening to an employee practice his English. He
        told me how tourists see much more of the country than
        native Laotians ever do, mostly due to economic
        restraints, and how he was going to Luang Prabang for the
        first time in his life with an American
        &quot;friend&quot; of his next month. &quot;His name is
        Simon Taylor; maybe you know him?&quot; came the
        inevitable question, which I&#146;ve learned to answer as
        politely as possible. </p>
        <p>I found Fred back at the Scandinavian bakery, and we
        took another sunset walk, further up the Mekong this
        time. We were surprised to discover a whole string of
        very animated hostess-style bars built on bamboo
        platforms. Dinner was at a popular Italian place, on the
        Fountain Square of course, packed with members of the NGO
        set loudly discussing available monies and possible
        alliances.</p>
        <p>Our bellies were still full of pasta the next morning,
        allowing us to forgo breakfast and hit the road earlier
        than ever. The light was still quite dim as we pedaled
        out of the wakening town, past begging monks, slow-motion
        cyclists on their way to work and countless roadside
        baguette vendors. We eventually gave in to temptation and
        tried this traditional Lao breakfast, a faithful replica
        of a French baguette smeared with rather dubious luncheon
        meat and hot spices. Not a bad BikeBrats breakfast, if
        the truth be told, and one easily consumed while
        straddling a bike. </p>
        <p>The traffic grew increasingly sparse as we put
        distance between ourselves and the town. Two friendly
        agriculture students rode alongside me for nearly a
        half-hour, practicing their English and providing me with
        information on the road ahead. They turned off towards
        their school at kilometer 24, plunging us into silence. </p>
        <p>For the remainder of the long, long day, the deserted
        road led through rolling scrub forest broken here and
        there by irregularly shaped rice paddies. Most of the
        peasants we saw were engaged in the various steps of
        planting rice, and we were slightly shocked to see
        children joining in. Shouldn&#146;t they be in school? We
        looked for schools in every village we passed through and
        saw none. &quot;Village&quot; is actually an
        overstatement here, for what passes for a <i>ban</i> in
        these parts is seldom more than a tiny concentration of
        ramshackle bamboo huts, often spaced hundreds of meters
        apart from one another. The evident poverty was a bit
        alarming after the relative prosperity of Luang Prabang
        and Vientiane, and we were impressed by how everything in
        these people&#146;s lives comes from the land. Aside from
        the occasional mud-encrusted tee shirt, these people live
        without any of the consumer goods that we take for
        granted. The &quot;seven-elevens&quot; that are so
        ubiquitous in Thailand are nearly absent in Laos; when we
        did actually find a place selling bottled water it
        usually sold little else, maybe some packets of washing
        powder and a couple of odds and ends imported from across
        the Mekong. The glaring exception to this general rule
        are the highway rest stops (clearly designed for passing
        buses) spaced at fifty or so kilometers apart, each
        featuring a whole string of dirty little restaurants and
        shops on both sides of the road. We stopped at the first
        of these and ordered some truly nasty chicken fried rice
        from the local queen, who added insult to injury by
        overcharging us grossly. I knew we were in for it when I
        asked him how much (&quot;Thao Dai?&quot; is one of the
        few Lao phrases we&#146;ve picked up) and four girls
        hovered around a nearby table as the bill was prepared,
        giggling wildly between consultations of our queeny
        friend, now engaged in hacking up yet another rubbery
        chicken. With a coy, expectant look, the bravest of the
        girls deposited the ridiculously padded bill before me.
        Rather than complain overtly (my Lao skills being too
        deficient to do so), I paid the full sum, all the while
        grumbling to Fred with just a touch of theatricality, and
        wondering if we&#146;d have to ask prices in advance of
        ordering from here on in. </p>
        <p>At kilometer 100 we found something resembling an
        actual village, and stopped to soak in the novelty of it
        all. The café we had chosen had the usual band of
        slackers hanging out in front of it, only these boys were
        in their twenties or so and all were wearing luridly
        colored polish on their long nails. They hung on each
        other with more than the usual amount of
        demonstrativeness, and we wondered if they considered
        themselves queer. It&#146;s so difficult to tell in this
        part of the world&#133; I hypothesized that the nail
        affectation was more a display of being somehow superior
        to fieldwork than a gender statement, but the linguistic
        barrier made an interview impossible. Even capturing a
        photo was difficult; whenever I&#146;d pick up the camera
        they&#146;d retreat into the shadows or thrust their
        hands into their pockets.</p>
        <p>The terrain grew hillier here, and the villages looked
        increasingly poorer. Whenever we passed through one of
        these we caused enormous commotion, especially among the
        younger set. &quot;<i>Sabai Diiii</i>&quot; they screamed
        over and over. Fred reflected that he preferred being
        greeted in the local lingo than with &quot;Hello
        Mister&quot; and I agreed whole-heartedly. </p>
        <p>Pakxan appeared with little fanfare. The huge dot
        representing it on the map had made us expect an actual
        town, but it&#146;s little more than a dusty little
        crossroads. Utterly exhausted, we limply examined our two
        accommodation choices (neither very savory) and sought
        out something to nibble on. Apparently food is not
        something normally consumed in Pakxan at three in the
        afternoon; the only thing we could find was a little
        straw-roofed hovel selling <i>pho</i>, a noodley soup
        I&#146;ve always associated with Vietnam (and
        mispronounced, for that matter, before Ly set me straight
        the other day). While hot food hardly sounded appealing
        to us in our sweat-drenched state, the soup was
        delicious, and the woman serving us was friendly,
        gracious, and fair in her pricing. </p>
        <p>We pedaled back to the outskirts of town, where the
        first guesthouse we had looked at had a better feeling
        than the filth-encrusted &quot;hotel&quot; near the
        alleged town&#146;s alleged center. The family running
        the place was incredibly friendly, and we had difficulty
        averting our gaze from the amazingly buff son shoveling
        dirt out in front, a sheen of sweat covering his compact
        brown body. After a necessary splash in the shared <i>mandi</i>
        (or whatever they call the in-house mosquito breeding
        centers here), we collapsed onto our hard bed,
        luxuriating in the oscillations of the electric fan. Just
        as I was about to nod off, a knock was applied to our
        door. Fred got up and answered it and I thought I heard a
        woman&#146;s voice speaking English. Was I hallucinating?
        What could another <i>falang</i> possibly be doing in
        Pakxan? </p>
        <p>My curiosity got the best of me and I dragged myself
        out of bed to look out the door and check out Sarah, a
        thirtyish Scottish girl burdened by an enormous backpack.
        After a cursory chat (&quot;7000 kip for a room here
        (that&#146;s two yankee dollars to you and me); I
        can&#146;t believe how expensive it is down here in the
        South. You guys must be saving lots of money using the
        bikes, though&#133;&quot;) we made plans to meet her
        later for dinner.</p>
        <p>Our hostess indicated that food could be had next
        door, in a cavernous highway-side restaurant/convenience
        store/multi-family home. Sarah proved to be agreeable
        company. We learned that she&#146;d been living in Hong
        Kong for the last few years and had been travelling on
        her own for a few months already, and was now on her way
        to Vietnam. We were especially interested in the fact
        that she knew how to play backgammon. When I retreated to
        our room to get our board, I found that our hotel had
        been transformed into a bordello during our absence.
        Several heavily made-up girls hung around outside, very
        curious as to my relationship with Sarah.
        &quot;Madame?&quot; they asked inquisitively, to which I
        responded in the affirmative. Later that night on my way
        to the toilet I noticed that the action outside had
        heated up even more. Several army jeeps crowded the
        mudpatch out front and more giggly girls had
        materialized. Clad only in my underwear, I slunk
        stealthily through the hallway, unnoticed by the
        carousing brass and their consorts. </font></p>
