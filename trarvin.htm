    <tr>
        <td><font face="Arial"><b>Friday, 27 December, around
        Vinales, 25.3miles</b></font><p><font size="2" face="Arial">It was a sticky heavy day in the Vinales
        valley, even in the wee hours. Fred and I did our usual
        thing of watching the sun rise &#150;in this case, an
        awesome spectacle&#151;and waiting for the restaurant to
        open for breakfast. Not surprisingly, breakfast was
        another service nightmare, taking forever to get a half
        cup of coffee from the bitchy waitress (named Trufina, we
        later learned). But it felt great to jump onto our
        unloaded bikes sans helmets for a day of aimless
        exploring. First we visited the tacky, bewildering Mural
        Prehistorico, which consists of limestone cliff painted
        in lurid colors, depicting snails, dinosaurs and cavemen.
        We met a nerdy guy from Norway there who informed us of
        the stated penalty for Americans visiting Cuba: $50,000
        and up to ten years in prison. Oops! And we&#146;re going
        to publicize that we did this? Part of me wants to get
        into trouble and become a cause celebre, with every ACLU
        lawyer begging to represent us; but of course that could
        mess up our plans to spend the next two years on our
        bikes.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">We lunched in a beautiful
        old house in lovely Vinales town, la Casa de Don Tomas.
        Its menu stated its commitment to &quot;Cuban
        gastronomy,&quot; but on our plates we found the same
        canned vegetable medley they dished out everywhere else
        we&#146;d been. Fine food and communism don&#146;t mix,
        it seem; and the Casa de Don Tomas was a state-run
        enterprise, where the chef and waitress, and even the
        musicians, were government employees. The ambiance was
        great, though, and so was the view of the town&#146;s
        elegantly colonnaded main street, in which a constant
        stream of Chinese bicycles languidly passed by.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Remounting our own trusty
        two-wheelers, we headed out towards the Cueva del Indio
        on a road which passed through more breathtaking scenery.
        Another state-run tourist trap, the Cueva could have been
        skipped, especially the carnival of beggars and souvenir
        sellers that descended upon us at the exit.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Heading back towards town,
        I insisted we take a side road. More gorgeous scenery,
        two boys killing a heron for the hell of it, and
        increasingly menacing clouds. Just as we got into Vinales
        proper it started pouring. We took refuge under the
        colonnades and eventually made our way a couple of blocks
        up the street to La Casa de Dago, a bar and paladar.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;Paladar,&quot; Anita
        explained to us later, was the name of a fictional
        restaurant started by a fictional woman on a Brazilian
        soap opera. In Cuba it now refers to any privately-run
        restaurant, a new phenomenon that seems to be enjoying
        unbridled success. While we didn&#146;t sample
        Dagoberto&#146;s food, we enjoyed his beer and
        hospitality as the rain came down in sheets. It soon
        became clear that Dagoberto is Vinales&#146; most visible
        capitalist, and that everyone around town had a strong
        opinion of the man.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">I then made the huge
        mistake of capitulating to Fred&#146;s impatience. He had
        a big hard-on about getting back to the hotel &#150;a 3km
        uphill pump. When the rain subsided a bit, we got on our
        bikes, but no sooner had we done so than it started
        pouring again &#150;a hardcore tropical downpour. We were
        completely drenched in a matter of seconds. The episode
        had its humorous side, I suppose, but it also taught me
        to hold my ground against Fred&#146;s impatience next
        time. He was perfectly capable of getting his ass up that
        wet hill on his own. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Of course, once we made it
        to the top the rain stopped. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Dinner was yet another
        exercise in frustration. For some reason, Fred preferred
        not to go down to Dagoberto&#146;s (who said he&#146;d
        even come pick us up in his &#146;48 Ford), opting
        instead for the insular tourist hell of our hotel&#146;s
        dining room. Trufina was our waitress again and her
        strident avoidance of serving us drove Fred nuts. At the
        end of the meal he stood up and dressed Trufina down,
        screaming at her in English before running off to Anita
        to tattle on her comrade. I thought Fred was overreacting
        and was embarrassed to be associated with him. This
        wasn&#146;t the Hilton, after all, and what did he expect
        from communistic service anyway? The boy still has to
        learn that the world is a big place and it doesn&#146;t
        always operate by his rules. For me, that&#146;s part of
        what makes travel fun &#150;but apparently not for Fred.</font></p>

        <td><font face="Arial"><b>Saturday, 28 December, Vinales
        to Santa Lucia and back, 62.6miles</b></font><p><font size="2" face="Arial">Saturday&#146;s bike ride was more
        ambitious, and by the grace of God, the weather
        cooperated. It was clear and crisp as we set off, first
        to breakfast at a competing state-run hotel called La
        Ermita (the boycott of Trufina was on), then on past the
        Mural Prehistorico, though Cuba&#146;s pristine
        countryside. We climbed and dipped through a lush valley
        full of tobacco fields and tall trees. After 20 miles we
        hit our first town &#150;Pons&#151;where we caused a
        sensation at the guara stand. Guara is pure,
        freshly-squeezed sugarcane juice and a supposed energy
        booster. A fellow patron said we&#146;d be needing it,
        too, since the road to Santa Lucia was hilly.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">And he wasn&#146;t
        kidding. Fred said the road must have been designed by
        Puerto Ricans, for it twisted up and down in search of
        the highest and lowest points, just like the road we took
        over the mountains in Puerto Rico a year before. Soon we
        were pedaling through pine forests. During a roadside
        stop another Cuban racer zoomed by, sporting all the
        fanciest cycling duds. Then a rather inbred-looking
        peasant cruised by on his oxsled, which scraped noisily
        against the asphalt. The only other vehicles we noticed
        were an unlikely-looking taxi parked in front of a shack
        and a broken-down truck.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">It was blazingly hot when
        we rolled into Santa Lucia just before noon. The town was
        ugly and poor, an old mining center gone to hell. The
        town&#146;s only restaurant wasn&#146;t open yet, but a
        local youth said he knew of a place for refreshments. He
        led us on foot through a ridiculously long labyrinth of
        increasingly scruffy lanes. Fred cracked at about the
        tenth time the guy said &quot;only a hundred meters
        more,&quot; whereupon we jumped back on our bikes and
        rode back to the town center for palettas &#150;frozen
        treats on a stick.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The coastal road back to
        Vinales was boring, long and in piteously bad shape. We
        also had to fight an evil headwind and a blisteringly hot
        sun. Just as we had run out of water, at about mile 50, a
        mirage appeared as we rounded a bend: a glistening gas
        station in the middle of nowhere. Yes, they had a dollar
        shop, too, where we gleefully dropped four Yankee
        greenbacks on water, a coke and various sweet and salty
        American agouti snacks &#150;all in a sanitized,
        overairconditioned environment. We met a Cuban-American
        here who was cruising his native land in a flashy rented
        Hyundai. The locals, meanwhile, drooled over our bikes
        and mysteriously carried gasoline away in little plastic
        bags.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">From here the scenery
        turned awesome again as we reentered the land of mogotes.
        On the climb back up towards the Cueva del Indio we
        stopped to chat with a geeky Swiss dude who had just
        begun his cycle tour of the island on a Flying Pigeon
        that he had purchased in Vinales for $40. He said he
        planned to stay in people&#146;s houses, since you
        &quot;couldn&#146;t bring a girl back to your room in a
        hotel.&quot; Fred and I pronounced him officially
        brain-damaged and continued our climb. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">In Vinales we stopped at
        Dago&#146;s again for beers and Cuban pizza (it was a
        rather greasy concoction, and we made the unfortunate
        choice of ordering it with ham). The place was hopping.
        Dago was obviously drunk, wearing a Che Guevara tee shirt
        and dancing with Italian tourist ladies to the
        three-piece combo who probably weren&#146;t working for
        the state (nor for pesos, for that matter). Enrique, our
        cycling friend from two days before, cruised by in the
        street and we invited him to join us for beers. We talked
        politics. His view of America was that it was a dangerous
        place full of criminals and homeless people who
        couldn&#146;t get health care. His wife, on the other
        hand, had just delivered a baby in the state capital free
        of charge, and his baby would be able to attend free
        schools. His dad, he explained, had known real poverty
        &#150;even famine&#151;under the former regime. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">We followed Enrique back
        to his nearby home, where we met his family and scoped
        out his living conditions. His wife was shockingly young,
        but they said they didn&#146;t plan an having another
        baby for at least five years. His mom lived in the house
        too, a rugged-looking woman who made us delicious coffee
        as Enrique showed us around the yard. There were dogs and
        pigs and chickens and banana trees and coffee trees and
        God knows what else. And nearby, he explained, he had a
        field full of various crops. We decided that we
        didn&#146;t have to worry about Enrique&#146;s family
        going hungry, and wondered what he thought of our
        bourgeois, decadent ways.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Exhausted from our ride,
        we turned in early that night without dinner, thus
        forgoing another ordeal with Trufina.</font></p>
