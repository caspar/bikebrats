    <tr>
        <td><font size="2" face="Arial"><strong>Wednesday 18
        December 1996, Bacalar to Uxmal, 67 miles</strong></font><p><font size="2" face="Arial">After a night of fitful sleep on
        the hard ground, I panicked upon awakening, thinking that
        the sun had already risen (it hadn&#146;t). We had mucho
        miles to cover and I was hell-bent on getting as many
        under our belts as possible before the hot part of the
        day. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">--Since then I&#146;ve
        chilled considerably, having learned that flexibility is
        the hallmark of a good traveler. Besides, it wasn&#146;t
        long before we grew accustomed to the sun and would think
        nothing of pedaling straight through midday. But this
        particular morning we both woke up a bit cranky, perhaps
        due to a mediocre night&#146;s sleep, yet more likely a
        (justified, I realize in retrospect) reaction on
        Fred&#146;s part to my anality. He said he needed
        breakfast before we could ride anywhere, and all I could
        hear was the ticking clock. Reluctantly, I indulged his
        desire to eat as we spent an agonizingly slow hour and a
        half at the hotel where all our friends from the previous
        night were staying, a funky place with an amazing view
        over a lagoon, and a decor inspired by the Madonna Inn
        (if they had a &quot;Mexican Beach&quot; themed room,
        that is). They had coffee, though, which is what I needed
        to take the edge off my foul mood. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">So with food in
        Fred&#146;s belly and coffee in mine, we hit the road
        (now known as &quot;the agouti trail&quot;) with
        lightened spirits and heavier loads. It was on this
        morning as well that the genesis of the &quot;mile
        system&quot; occurred, whereupon we trade the
        windbreaking position with each mile. Today especially it
        helped us pick up the pace and break the monotony of the
        road. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">At about mile 30 the
        turnoff appeared, the shortcut to Merida that sliced
        through 60 miles of nothing before hooking up with the
        main highway again. We were delighted to find that the
        headwind we had been battling diminished as we changed
        our course more westwards, yet lamented that this also
        robbed us of all remaining shade. The first village came
        quickly, not a moment too soon and like a mirage. What
        appeared to be the town&#146;s (San Lazaro
        Somethingorother) only tienda was beautifully stocked
        with salty snacks and refrescos. The friendly
        proprietress made us four of the tastiest sandwiches I
        have ever eaten. Outside the shop, what seemed like the
        village&#146;s entire adolescent population poked at our
        bikes with marvel in their eyes. They tolk us the next
        village was 30 kilometers away, and with the sun blazing
        down, Fred and I felt as if we were about to cross a
        desert.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">This village &#150;or its
        outskirts, which consisted of a gritty
        &quot;loncheria&quot; (divey bar/restaurant) and a
        &quot;ponchera/llantera&quot; (tire repair), presumably
        owned by one crusty old guy&#151; appeared just when we
        thought we&#146;d expire from the heat. We played
        backgammon and consumed vast quantities of liquid while
        observing the local languid youths and the considerable
        interest aroused by the breakdown of a mysterious public
        vehicle. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">At 1:30 or so we hit the
        road again. The thermometer on my bike read 100 degrees.
        We rode most of our alternating miles on the shadier left
        side of the essentially empty road. Most of the vehicles
        we encountered were other bicycles, ridden by peasants
        and invariably loaded down with some sort of crop. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Some 25 miles further,
        after pedaling nearly 70 miles since breakfast, we
        stopped at the turnoff to a village marked on the map as
        &quot;Pres. Juarez&quot; to ask a boy how far it was to
        the next village. We were beginning to wonder about where
        we&#146;d be setting up our tent, not exactly looking
        forward to it. The boy was all but mute, but soon an
        adult emerged from the jungle to tell us it was far, some
        30 k, to the next village, but that a bus was on its way
        any minute, and could take us and our bikes to a town
        with a hotel.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">It wasn&#146;t an option
        we had considered before, yet it sounded too good a deal
        to pass up, so we dug our heels in for an ennervatingly
        long wait. The shadows were getting longer and longer and
        when the bus finally arrived, it was an hour late. Still,
        we were grateful not to have to spend the night in this
        godforsaken cesspool. The driver fucked us on the fare,
        but it was great to be tearing through the countryside
        without making any effort. It didn&#146;t take long to
        get to Jose Maria Morales, where I found us a slimy room
        in the only hotel in town, above the zocalo. Looking
        back, Jose Maria Morales was one of the uglier towns we
        saw in Mexico, offering little beyond the taco stand
        where we were served by a sparkling waitress/law student.
        The only beer we could find was at an outdoor bar
        featuring an excruciatingly loud band and unsavory,
        inebriated patrons. We opted for ice cream in a shop run
        by the only white Mexicans we saw in this town. Back in
        our depressing hotel (where a deer was kept in a cage in
        the grimy courtyard for God knows what purpose) we pulled
        the bed away from the wall to keep the insects at bay and
        covered the dubious sheets with a sleeping bag.</font></p>

        December 1996, Muna to Uxmal, 10 miles</strong></font><p><font size="2" face="Arial">The next morning surprised us.
        Outside our window it was drizzling and&#133; cold; were
        we still dreaming? We went immediately downstairs to the
        bus station and bought tickets to Muna, the closest town
        to the ruins of Uxmal and a much-needed princess fix at
        Club Med. Thus, &quot;Mayab&quot; &#150;the name of the
        bus company&#151;became part of our vocabulary, used most
        often as a verb meaning &quot;to stick our bikes in the
        bus instead of riding through unpleasant weather.&quot;
        After another tamale breakfast we were mayabing again.
        The ticket agent had said the trip would take three
        hours, but I predicted half that given the short
        distance. What I didn&#146;t know is that the bus would
        stop in every rinkydink town along the route, so it
        actually took us four hours to get to Muna, a mere
        hundred clicks away.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The bus dumped us
        alongside the zocalo, where we changed into our wet
        weather biking gear under a menacing sky. Just outside of
        town we encountered our first real hill of the trip, and
        it was a steep motherfucker. To compound our misery, it
        started to pour as we reached the top, but the rain
        tapered off considerably as we reached Uxmal.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The hotel seemed
        outrageously opulent in comparison to the previous
        nights&#146; lodgings. We stuffed ourselves with good
        food and booze before hitting the ruins, which were very
        impressive. Fred kept saying that they didn&#146;t hold a
        candle to Tikal, but he had to admit that the restoration
        had been beautifully done and that the carvings were in
        much better shape &#150;mostly since Uxmal enjoyed its
        heyday some centuries after Tikal did. After marvelling
        at the oddly-shaped &quot;Pyramid of the Magician&quot;
        and the enormous &quot;Convent,&quot; we set off in
        search of the far-flung &quot;Temple of the Phalli,&quot;
        which turned out to be little more than a pile of rocks
        crowned by a penis-shaped drainspout. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Back at Club Med, we got
        trashed on mai tais before a scrumptious dinner, followed
        by pool in the games room and still more drinks. When we
        checked out the next morning, our food and beverage bill
        was three times as high as the price of the room.</font></p>

    <tr>
        <td><font size="2" face="Arial"><strong>Friday, 20
        December 1996, Uxmal to Oxkutzcab, 44 miles</strong></font><p><font size="2" face="Arial">It was another early start, since
        there was much to see on the road to Oxkutzcab: no fewer
        than four Mayan sites, plus an allegedly spectacular
        cave. The sky was blissfully overcast, yet everyone
        assured us it wouldn&#146;t rain. And the roller-coaster
        of a road was a pleasant change of pace, as was the
        abundant wildlife we saw along the way.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Our first cultural stop
        was at Kabah, famous for its wall of Cha&#146;ac masks.
        Cha&#146;ac was the rain god venerated in this supposedly
        dry area, and a god that we didn&#146;t feel like pissing
        off on that particular day. Fred and I were the only
        tourists there, which enhanced our visit, as did the
        wacky antics of the mayan-speaking staff. There were
        three of them, and they all appeared drunk, or just plain
        slaphappy. For some reason, they found our bikes
        hilarious. Their guffaws echoed about the ruins as we
        picked our way through them.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Sayil was the next stop,
        on a side road known as the Ruta Puuc, a gorgeous twisty
        affair with zero traffic and dense jungle on either side.
        We called it the &quot;Ruta Puke&quot; and enjoyed it as
        much as we could given the stiff stiff headwind from
        hell. Sayil was a huge palace with several floors and
        more rooms than you can shake a stick at. It, too, was
        tourist-free. We ate our junk food and oranges on top of
        it, admiring the view of the surrounding jungle.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">We skipped the ruins of
        Xlapac in the interest of time (wanting to hit the Loltun
        caves for the 2pm tour) and headed straight for Labna,
        famous for a courgeous archway. It was also interesting
        seeing the restoration work in progress on the
        now-familiar-looking palace. I took a photo of an
        archeologist-dude putting together the ring from the ball
        court. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The Loltun caves were much
        more heavily touristed than any of the Mayan sites,
        principally by Mexicans. Halfway into the
        Spanish-speaking tour, an elderly English-speaking guide
        appeared and gave us a private tour of the place
        &#150;your basic stalagtites and &#145;mites, with the
        added bonus of some Mayan and pre-Mayan remains.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">After a late late lunch of
        lime soup and beer at the Cave Café, we pushed onward
        (and mostly upward) to Oxkutzcab, a hilly 10k away. Other
        cyclists on crop-laden one-speeds marvelled at our
        ability to climb hills, and it was a rush zooming down
        the final ridge into our first proper Mexican town,
        complete with a lively market and extensive colonial-era
        church complex. &quot;Los Tucanes&quot; was the name of
        our hotel, and Fred didn&#146;t like it. It was perfectly
        clean, though unfortunately situated above a night club
        (or &quot;centro nocturno&quot;, as it was
        euphemistically known). After showers and yoga we took a
        tricitaxi (reminiscent of an Indonesian becak: a tricycle
        with room for two passengers in front) into the center of
        town to check out the church &#150;where a big
        Christmastime fiesta was being marred by a sudden
        downpour--, the lively market area, and the cavernous
        restaurant where we dined on mediocre food. All in all,
        it had been a fantastic day of being tourists on bikes.</font></p>
