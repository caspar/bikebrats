        to Nogaro, 74km</b></font><p><font size="2" face="Arial">In
        Pau you can eat Indian food prepared and served by gay
        boys on a terrace while gazing upon the very active
        lesbian bar across the street &#150;not at all what I
        expected from a far-flung provincial town in France.
        Having my preconceptions challenged or shattered is one
        of my favorite components of traveling, so I liked Pau a
        lot. We had a restful, restorative couple of days in this
        small, elegant capital of the Bearn region. The daytimes
        were spent wandering around the labyrinthine streets,
        doing laundry, computing and napping. Evenings were
        devoted to eating and bar hopping. By far the best of
        Pau&#146;s three homo bars is a little place called
        &quot;Le GoWest&quot;, run by the very welcoming Manu and
        Regis. Our first night there I got caught up with a trio
        of funny young Spaniards in town for a friend&#146;s
        wedding, with whom I worked on improving my Castilian
        Spanish. Francois was less amusing. After telling him my
        fresh impressions of Lourdes, he told me that he used to
        work there as a volunteer pushing around wheelchairs. He
        said that every four years or so a bona fide miracle
        occurs in Lourdes, though he&#146;d never seen one
        personally. He took personal offense at my skepticism and
        used the lame Catholic argument that God&#146;s existence
        is increasingly undeniable as science discovers the
        universe to be larger and larger; who but God could have
        created such a wonder? I also met an unlikely American
        boy living in Pau, a half-Japanese, half-Mexican lawyer
        named Steve who moved down there from Paris for the love
        of one boy before getting involved with another. He
        seemed happy living there at the base of the Pyrenees.
        It&#146;s actually a place I could probably live, too,
        and it was with some sadness and nostalgia that Fred and
        I left this morning. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Our goal for the day was a
        rather surreal one: the chapel of Notre Dame des
        Cyclistes (Our Lady of the Cyclists </font><a href="glfrandc.htm" target="contents"><font color="#800000"><strong>NDC</strong></font></a><font size="2" face="Arial">) near Labastide d&#146;Armagnac
        and Roquefort (is this where the cheese comes fro? I
        still haven&#146;t found out). I had learned about the
        cyclists chapel in a book and was thrilled to find it on
        the map near our intended route. Unlike Lourdes, this
        would be a pilgrimage we could make in earnest. We
        started the day backtracking by train to Tarbes, since
        the route from there northwards looked more appealing on
        the map. Our intention to do so caused a bit of a stir at
        the train station, since bringing bikes on the train
        wasn&#146;t really allowed. We lucked out with a friendly
        conductor, though, who not only permitted us to board,
        but actually helped us getting our bikes up and down the
        steep stairs &#150;living proof that not all the French
        are assholes. Forty-five minutes later, we were back in
        ugly Tarbes.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Today&#146;s route was not
        so much a road as a country lane, a narrow ribbon of
        bumpy asphalt meandering through a string of microscopic
        villages which dot the broad valley of the Adour river.
        Practically the only other vehicles we saw other than
        bikes were the traveling butchers and bakers who sold
        their goods out of the backs of their trucks. Not long
        past our miserable lunch of microwaved café fare, we
        entered the department of le Gers, synonymous with
        deepest, darkest France. On a nearby hill we saw a
        strange-looking structure reminiscent of Coit Tower in
        San Francisco, and figured it was a fancy water tower.
        Only afterwards did I learn from our guidebook that it
        had been a &quot;lantern of the dead&quot;, a hollow
        stone column built in the eleventh to twelfth century.
        The top would hold a beacon symbolizing the eternal life
        of the soul, and a priest would recite prayers for the
        dead at an alter inside, built above an ossuary (i.e. a
        place for bones). Further down the road we mistook
        another ancient structure in the distance &#150;La Tour
        des Thermes d&#146;Armagnac&#151;for a grain elevator. In
        reality it had been a chateau, though not a very
        beautiful one. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The chateau/fortress
        marked our first climb of the day, out of the Ardour
        valley and into the hills of Armagnac. The region&#146;s
        famous beverage was heralded by the numerous vineyards
        that suddenly surrounded us. Some had signs beside them
        advertising a new brand of pesticide. In the center of
        Nogaro, the largest town we&#146;d seen since Tarbes, we
        had our second lunch of the day in a boulangerie,
        contemplating the fifty k we had to go before reaching
        our intended destination and the big black clouds that
        were gathering. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">We hadn&#146;t even made
        it completely out of town before big fat drops began to
        fall on us. Right in front of us was a hotel touting a
        sauna and a pool; it didn&#146;t take us long to alter
        our plans and dig our heels in for the night at
        four-thirty, after only three and a half hours of
        pedaling. We thought we&#146;d do some yoga, but opted
        for a juicy nap followed by an unexceptional dinner in
        our hotel&#146;s dining room, which was occupied by
        several Parisian-looking yuppies at tables by themselves,
        pounding away at their laptops and gazing lovingly at
        their shiny Westons. Next to us were an odd-looking
        female couple smoking little cigars. One was so butch
        that Fred thought she was a man at first, while the other
        was all dolled up in a turn-of-the-century sort of
        costume of velvet and lace. After a while, the two of
        them disappeared behind a heavy curtain at the end of the
        room, from whence horrible sounds began to emerge. One of
        the woman (presumably the one in costume) was singing
        while the other one ground her organ. It sounded like a
        cat undergoing unanesthetized surgery, and Fred and I
        theorized who comprised their audience; possibly the Gers
        chapter of the National Masochists Society.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">I couldn&#146;t resist
        ordering Armagnac as a digestif, which I sweat out in the
        sauna afterwards. It was so hot in the little box that
        I&#146;m still sweating while I write this, wrapped in a
        towel with one eye on the t.v., which is showing
        Bertolucci&#146;s latest disaster, &quot;Stealing
        Beauty.&quot; We never did get around to doing yoga.
        Maybe tomorrow.</font></p>

        <td><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>22 May, Nogaro to St.
        Symphorien, 113 km</b></font><p><font size="2" face="Arial">Luckily the musicians from the evening were
        not performing as we had breakfast. I joked with the
        proprietor of the hotel about their performance and we
        laughed together about how special it was. This day's
        riding was much like the day before except for one
        miracle (we&#146;re considering changing the BratStats):
        there was no rain. We rolled along a ridge for most of
        the day by vineyards and little stands of trees. The
        weather was cool and clear and it was the first time we
        could say the word &quot;spring&quot; without following
        it with &quot;shower.&quot;</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">We rode quickly, filled
        with excitement that we would finally see the sanctuary
        dedicated to cyclists, &quot;Notre Dame de
        Cyclists.&quot; (</font><a href="glfrandc.htm" target="contents"><font color="#800000"><strong>NDC</strong></font></a><font size="2" face="Arial">) We saw the sign marking the road
        that led to the church and knew we had arrived somewhere
        special. Wrought iron and bicycle parts spelling out the
        name of the church in a large arch framed the path, the
        church and the fields surrounding this magical place. As
        we approached the chapel, surrounded in a little rose
        garden was a statue of her holding a globe dedicated to
        the free spirited rider. Crushed when we found out that
        the church was closed to visitors for the next three
        hours, and we had already exhausted all of the ridiculous
        photo opportunities outside in fifteen minutes.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">All the way into the next
        town, Labastide d&#146;Armanac, Andy pined about wanting
        to go back after a long lunch. I caved in. We lunched on
        the square that had inspired King Henri the fourth to
        build Place de Vosges in Paris. Built in 1197, it sported
        the same arched arcades as the new version with slightly
        less spectacular buildings. It marked the center of a
        very square town that a bird&#146;s eye view revealed in
        the tourist office. In fact all bastides were planned to
        be square, fortified, and, hence, easily defended in the
        event of war (which happened with some frequency as the
        brits and frogs fought for territory here.) </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Before lunch we assumed
        that the town was absolutely uninhabited. Not a single
        shop was open and there was no one on the street. Soon we
        saw crowds coming down a street all dressed in their best
        clothing walking away from some event. I guessed a
        funeral, and when we followed the crowds to the source it
        was the cemetery. We had the misfortune of asking the
        friend of the grieving son where to find an ATM,
        following up with the question &quot;who died
        anyway?&quot; He pointed at his friend and said &quot;his
        dad.&quot; We gave our condolences and looked for lunch.
        Absolutely everyone in town was at the funeral and
        Labastide d&#146;Armanac &quot;came alive&quot;
        afterwards. Backgammon at a quiet little café hidden
        away off the square followed our simple lunch of crepes
        and salad. Andrew got excited about our impending visit
        to the shrine and even lost a few games to me.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">We raced back to Notre
        Dame to find the caretaker just opening the doors to the
        house of worship. She too had been at the interment and
        had seen us lurking and asking for directions. The church
        and gift shop was like no other I&#146;d been to. The
        walls were covered with a collage of photos, jerseys,
        flags, votives and bike parts. More colorful and
        beautiful than any other church we&#146;ve visited. After
        opening the door the caretaker (who absolutely refused to
        be photographed) began to light candles on a candelabra
        made from bicycle parts. We began to notice that all of
        the religious &quot;furniture&quot; in the place was made
        from parts or wrought iron made to look like parts of
        bicycles. We spent literally our last centimes on
        postcards before noticing that she was also selling
        stickers for bicycles with the name of the church and a
        picture of &quot;Notre Dame,&quot; when we asked if
        she&#146;d take a french check for them, she gave them to
        us. So moved, I gave here my Santa Cruz Bicycle Trip
        water bottle filled with water from Lourdes for display.
        She put it on display with the fifty other water bottles
        some of the 25k other visitors had left. (maybe we should
        have gone to &quot;Notre Dame d&#146;Elevators.&quot; See
        following day)</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">As I mentioned earlier the
        day was really lovely, and we rode until sunset through
        charming little villages and groves of pine trees. One of
        the villages we went through was Roquefort, which we
        assumed was of blue cheese dressing fame. We were wrong.
        Another was Luxey which housed another shrine of sorts.
        The Cercle d&#146;Union, a private club until a little
        while ago (16 years), housed all the towns action. Here
        septuagenarians tilted back brews, played cards, smoked,
        chatted, read the paper and laughed at our ridiculous
        outfits when we arrived. As a member, Andrew found out,
        you could come there without buying a drink. The
        membership fee was pretty heady, suggested 25FF, nearly
        five dollars per year. After an Orangina I headed outside
        avoiding the thick cloud of smoke that wafted around in
        the place, while Andrew stayed inside and became best
        friends with the proprietress of the Cercle and her 76
        year old friend who had ridden his bicycle from Paris six
        or seven times.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Outside I met a peer of
        Andrew&#146;s buddy who tolerated my french and even
        complimented me on it. Touting that his friends in grade
        school couldn&#146;t speak it and had to resort to
        patois. He told me that he rides his bike every day to
        the club and enjoyed his retired life in Luxey. He&#146;d
        been deported during the war to Norway and was excited to
        have had the opportunity to have visited there so
        cheaply. This was the land that time forgot. There are
        probably only a few more years of beret-headed frenchmen
        toting baguettes smoking Gitanes riding bikes. So
        you&#146;d better hit Luxey before they illegalize
        tobacco and they all die off.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">We were frustrated many
        times trying to find a hotel that night. First in Luxey
        where a fat &quot;wall-eyed&quot; woman gave us no regard
        and told us she was full though all the keys were on the
        board behind her. We pedaled on another twenty kilometers
        as the sun hovered forever on the horizon. Here the
        owners of an Auberge told us of a &quot;gite&quot;
        (bed-n-breakfast) 1k up the road. After two kilometers we
        turned around and headed for the next town where we knew
        there was a hotel, arriving there just as the pale yellow
        orb was dipping below the horizon. Not impressed with the
        accomodations, Andrew started to bargain with our
        seemingly Arabic hotel operator in front of the other
        guests. &quot;I am not a rug merchant,&quot; he quipped,
        ending bargaining. We didn&#146;t even change out of our
        smelly biking attire for dinner. Thomas whipped us up a
        simple meal of an omelet, steak and fries. The table wine
        was great, signaling to us that we were close to
        Bordeaux.</font></p>

        hurt like hell. It took a long time to heal, too. My dad
        wasn&#146;t exactly thrilled by the idea, since we
        weren&#146;t Muslims, but after I went out and had it
        cut, there wasn&#146;t much he could do about it, was
        there?&quot; Thomas, our innkeeper from the Capo Verde
        islands, was telling us about his circumcision at age
        fourteen in Senegal while we were eating breakfast. He
        did it to get dates, he said, since none of the local
        girls wanted anything to do with his foreskin, and he
        illustrated his subsequent success to us by thrusting his
        hips in suggestive pantomime. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">I heard many other
        chapters in the Thomas story, like how he moved to France
        for his studies, met a French girl who left him after
        sixteen years of marriage. Aside from running St.
        Symphorien&#146;s only bar/restaurant/hotel entirely by
        himself, he is a martial arts instructor, though his
        teaching is limited to theory since having some obscure
        problems with his stomach. For his next vacation
        he&#146;s returning to Senegal to marry his childhood
        sweetheart, who&#146;s also just finished a
        sixteen-year-old relationship. I could have stayed
        listening to his stories &#150;told in an inimitably
        animated fashion&#151;all day, but it we wanted to reach
        Bordeaux before lunch.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">On our way out, Thomas
        introduced us to another guest: a youngish half-French,
        half-American guy who was born in Hawaii and now works
        selling and installing high-tech laser carrot graters. Is
        St. Symphorien the weirdest place in France? </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The road to Bordeaux was
        pretty boring. Most of it was through the same scruffy
        pine forest we&#146;d seen yesterday. I was dragging
        seriously, for some reason or another, and Fred decided
        he wanted to break the St. Symphorien-Bordeaux speed
        record. I pleaded for him to stop in the first village
        with a bakery, where I chewed on an apple slipper
        (chausson a pommes; Fred calls them &quot;apple
        socks&quot;) and tried to feel more energetic. While
        doing this, I watched the steady trickle of customers
        walking out with their three-franc baguettes, wondering
        how a village baker manages to make a living.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">As we approached Bordeaux,
        the traffic became seriously irritating, causing us to
        opt for a calmer, more circuitous route through the
        Graves vineyards and an endless suburban maze of
        roundabouts and housing projects. The closer we got to
        the town center, the scarier the traffic got. We saw a
        couple of accidents on our way into town, including a car
        that had managed to run straight into a bus. At Place des
        Victoires, we stopped to get our bearings and met three
        older American guys touring France on their bikes. They
        weren&#146;t particularly friendly, but I envied their
        relatively light loads. A little further, an anal French
        cycling enthusiast criticized the angle of my seat and
        gave us some addresses of bike shops where I could get my
        wheel fixed.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">It didn&#146;t take us
        long to score a room in the pedestrian zone that
        constitutes the heart of the oldest part of Bordeaux. And
        that was when it happened. We were loading our bags into
        the elevator when the closing door slammed right onto
        Fred&#146;s nose. It made a horrible sound, and I knew
        right away that we had to call a doctor.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">When the doctor finally
        arrived (one of the finest services in France is called
        SOS Medecins, kind of a roving emergency room that comes
        to you), all he could say was &quot;Ce n&#146;est pas
        evident,&quot; and give Fred a prescription for x-rays at
        a nearby clinic. The radiologist there showed us that
        Fred&#146;s schnoz was truly broken, though not severely.
        It would heal in a couple of weeks, he said, and all that
        could be done in the meantime was to smear cream on it. I
        endured a boondoggle of my own (an admittedly less
        painful one) searching for a replacement rim for my
        bicycle. From one bicycle shop to the next, I carried my
        damaged wheel through the crowded streets of uptight
        Bordeaux. People looked at me as if I was the incarnation
        of the plague, the essence of bad taste. Though both
        shops had said over the phone that they had the part, all
        it took was one look to elicit the usual French response
        of &quot;Non, c&#146;est impossible.&quot;</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">For cocktail hour we went
        to a queer bar called &quot;l&#146;Alibi.&quot; As per
        usual in France, we were treated like invisible men
        inside; no one would return our looks or smiles; only the
        bartender so much as acknowledged our existence. I broke
        the ice by broaching a subject very dear to the French,
        asking the barman very loudly, &quot;Where&#146;s a good
        place for dinner?&quot; At this, a small committee was
        urgently formed at the end of the bar, and after much
        hushed deliberation, an emissary was sent in the form of
        a middle-aged fashion victim who introduced himself as
        Denis. Denis instructed us to go to a place called
        &quot;Les Graves du Parlement&quot; and drew us a very
        elaborate map to get there. When I told him I&#146;d come
        back and slap him if we didn&#146;t like the food, he got
        all excited.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Dinner was more
        serviceable than spectacular, but we were entertained by
        the antics of the many homo passersby, many of them
        dressed in the outfit du jour: black and white plaid
        pants and bright red hiking boots. (&quot;C&#146;est la
        mode,&quot; identically-dressed Denis explained to me
        later, exhibiting an astounding lack of imagination).</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The Spartacus guide
        informed us that another bar called &quot;Le Moyen
        Age&quot; (The Middle Ages) was the oldest gay bar in
        France. Could the editors been referring to demographics?
        In any case, the bar was appropriately named; we were the
        youngest customers by at least two decades. We sat down
        next to an anglophonic trio who actually said
        &quot;hello&quot; to us. Chris and Graham were Brittanic,
        and the hysterically flamboyant Michael was American. All
        three worked on the &quot;Silver Cloud&quot;, a big
        cruise ship we had noticed earlier in the harbor. We
        weren&#146;t surprised when they told us they were the
        entertainment; Michael and Chris were singer/dancers
        while Graham just sang. They (actually Michael, since he
        seldom let his Brit companions get a word in edgewise)
        enlightened us as to the strange culture of working on a
        cruise ship. I found it rather fascinating, and
        Michael&#146;s strongly voiced biases had me practically
        crying with laughter. He referred to gay men as
        &quot;mary&#146;s&quot; and used &quot;chicken&quot; as a
        term of endearment (as in &quot;We haven&#146;t been to a
        mary bar since Genoa, chicken, and what a hellhole that
        place is.&quot;). </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">All the noise we were
        making was eliciting decidedly unfriendly glares from the
        sullen French patrons, so we led our new friends back to
        the Alibi to shake that place up a little. I caused quite
        a drama when a French boy I was talking to accidentally
        burned my arm with his cigarette (If you remember to ask,
        I&#146;ll show you the scar), which caused me to jerk and
        spill some beer on both of us. Showing absolutely no
        concern for me, the boy went into a total tizzy fit over
        his shirt smelling like beer, which angered me enough to
        add to his misfortune. This caused a general gasp from
        the bar at large, and for a while I felt like persona non
        grata, pleased with myself for breaking some rules in
        this city so obsessed with decorum. One French boy who
        would talk to me after the incident was an adorable
        nineteen-year-old student of Italian called Florial,
        whose sympathy, I suspect, stemmed partly from his being
        a virulent anti-smoker himself. He said that Bordeaux was
        famous for its pretentiousness and its
        &quot;faux-bourgeois&quot; (a concept that was reiterated
        verbatim the next day by a taxi driver, who also
        confirmed my suspicions that Bordeaux drivers are among
        the rudest in the known universe).</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">At three o&#146;clock or
        so our singer/dancer friends tried to entice us to
        accompany them to a nightclub, but we were both
        dog-tired, so we dragged our smoke-and-beer-reeking
        selves back to bed.</font></p>

        Soulac-sur-Mer, 122 KM</b></font><p><font size="2" face="Arial">High grey clouds blanketed the sky as we
        exited Bordeaux, the climate matching the scenery of the
        port and the industrial part of the city. It was
        remarkable how quickly we&#146;d left the bustle of
        Bordeaux behind and were in the countryside, less than
        5km from the center. We saw a ruined church in the middle
        of a field that now served as a favorite grazing spot for
        some horses, and remarked that these must be the only
        French in church, given how much traffic there was on the
        road today. We&#146;d forgotten that it was French
        Mother&#146;s day, and it appeared that everyone was
        taking their mother to lunch. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Today was to be the day we
        were to see all of the places our favorite wines are
        grown and bottled. Names like Margaux, St. Estephe,
        Pauillac, Medoc and St. Julien appeared on the signs
        marking towns. The hillsides were covered with vines and
        grand chateaux. As we got closer and closer to Pauillac
        more and more rugby fans passed us, honking their horns
        because our red panniers matched their team colors. This
        became tedious as my neck began to fatigue from flinching
        at the sound each time one passed. We found a quieter
        road into Pauillac which revealed that not everyone in
        the Medoc region is rich from wine. Sad state-built
        apartments housed those with less glamorous jobs at the
        vineyards. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The only bad wine I&#146;d
        ever had from France was a Pauillac. The cork had gone
        bad and the wine was foul. We&#146;d been prepared for
        the bad attitudes of people in Medoc by some of the folks
        we&#146;d met in the city, but we weren&#146;t ready for
        the reception we had at lunch in Puillac. For the first
        time in Europe no one wanted to serve us lunch in our
        biking clothes. We&#146;d go to a restaurant that was
        doing a booming business, ask to be seated and were told
        they were no longer serving or there were no tables.
        Finally Andy pestered one hostess into giving us a table
        in the back. We had to ask three times for a menu and two
        times to order. Still Andy went away hungry because his
        fish was more bones than fish. Our visit to Pauillac had
        been foreshadowed by my experience with their wine. We
        barely made it out of lunch in time to make it to what
        was our planned highlight of the day.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">We&#146;d been excited to
        see Chateau Mouton-Rothschild and tour their vineyard.
        When we arrived we were disappointed to find that the
        afternoon tour was overbooked and there was no room for
        us. I had bought a 1988 four years ago and had saved it
        to celebrate our departure on this trip, only to drop and
        break it in our garage in Santa Cruz. We revealed this to
        the tour leader, Gaelle, and joked with her about the
        Scandalous 1993 label banned in America. (The
        international label has a pencil drawing of a nude
        &quot;leeetle&quot; girl in a provocative pose. A
        California woman&#146;s group declared it kiddie porn and
        had it removed. Thus the label is blank in America.)</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Our charms worked and next
        thing we knew we were on the tour. It was fascinating.
        Andy was especially interested in the handmade graphs on
        each cask that detailed the progress of the first
        fermentation of the wine. When we entered the hall of
        barrels where the second fermentation was underway our
        tour leader had an attack of giggles while describing the
        label drama. Every time she looked at Andrew she started
        laughing uncontrollably. She finally regained composure
        and continued the tour. We learned how Rothschild, a Jew,
        had escaped the Nazis and managed to hide his wine from
        the invading hoards. Saw Philippine&#146;s
        (Philippe&#146;s surviving daughter) immense personal
        cave that contains 55K bottles of Mouton-Rothschild and
        120K bottles of wine from the other <i>grands crus</i> of
        Bordeaux. The maitre de cave changes the corks of all the
        bottles every twenty years to preserve the wines. They
        taste each bottle to make sure that it is still good
        before they recork it - not a bad job?</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Still a little flustered
        by her giggle attack, our tour guide forgot to tell the
        tour group that the visit was over; she dashed into the
        tour building leaving us outside waiting for her. It was
        only after Andy and I walked in, found out the tour was
        over and told the others that the visit was complete that
        we broke up. We decided to buy an &#146;88 to have for a
        picnic to celebrate being in France. Recalling my
        clumsiness, the guide would not give me the bottle, but
        handed it to Andy.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The rest of the day was an
        unremarkable ride through vineyards against the wind to
        Soulac sur Mer. We stopped in a little backwater for some
        water and were treated to a serenade by a local drunk.
        When Marilyn&#146;s tune from &quot;How to marry a
        millionaire&quot; (or was it &quot;Gentlemen prefer
        blonds&quot;?) came on he began to dance and croon
        &quot;My aarrt beelongs to dahhdy&quot;. We arrived in
        Soulac sur Mer not long after that, but not before Andy
        got a flat on his new rim and tire. Celebrated the day
        with a great meal of fish, watching the endless sunset
        turn the sky from blue, to pink, to purple and finally to
        black. We treated ourselves to a second desert on the way
        back to our hotel, making it the day&#146;s ultimate act
        of gluttony.</font></p>

        in the morning.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">There was little or no
        foreshadowing in the first few hours of the day.
        Breakfast was tranquil, if uninspired (French breakfasts
        seldom hold surprises), served by our ever-cheerful,
        swishy host, Philippe. When we checked out, he tried
        giving me a map of La Gironde&#146;s many bike paths, but
        since we were about to leave the département, it would
        be of little use. Philippe told me that most of the paths
        followed abandoned road or rail beds built by the nazis,
        and that, ironically, it was German tourists for the most
        part who used them now.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">We rode along one of these
        paths for the ten kilometers to the ferry port, where we
        caught a boat across the wide mouth of the Gironde.
        Arriving in Royan, I told Fred I wanted to pull over to
        apply sunscreen and get a look at the beach. And this is
        when our unexpected meltdown occurred. First he
        complained about carrying the bottle of wine we purchased
        yesterday; then he got all upset over me somehow
        scratching him while rubbing sunscreen into his back, and
        launched into a tirade about how I didn&#146;t care about
        him, etc. etc. Unable to deal with his anger and abuse, I
        gave him the map and told him I&#146;d meet him in front
        of the cathedral at La Rochelle at eight. <i>(This is
        Andy&#146;s broad interpretation of the events and in no
        way represents the actual event &#150; complained =
        reminding him of his promise to do so, didn&#146;t care
        for = isn&#146;t careful&#133;.)</i></font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">For the rest of the day I
        felt alternately giddy and guilty for being on my own. I
        loved being able to pedal in any direction I chose,
        happily getting lost without a map, yet I worried about
        Fred and hoped he was getting along okay.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">I followed an intermittent
        bike path along the beaches and headlands west of Royan.
        This route involved some trial and error. Fred would have
        hated it; I kept hearing his voice in my head:
        &quot;Let&#146;s just take the main road.&quot; The towns
        I passed through were standard-issue French beach holiday
        factory, filled with Brits and Germans in search of good
        weather at off-season rates. But the beaches looked
        mighty inviting and some of the views over the multi-hued
        waters were stunning. After a while I stumbled upon a
        bike path which was more or less continuous, rolling and
        coasting through dunes and pine groves. The beaches were
        dotted with nazi bunkers sinking into the sand at crazy
        angles, resembling giant dice. The path petered out near
        an enormous and ornate lighthouse (le phare de la
        Coubre), and from here a marvelously quiet road led North
        through a hilly forest. At one point it climbed steeply
        to a height of 60 meters, where I was treated to a
        panoramic view. I began to think it would be a good idea
        for Fred and me to separate on a regular basis.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Another bike path led me
        through the forest to the outskirts of a little town
        called Ronce-les-Bains. I was starving and had no water
        left in my bottles, so the sleazy little café in front
        of me looked like the Promised Land. As I parked my bike
        I noticed my tire going flat (the new one again, bien
        sur), but decided to deal with my hunger and thirst
        first. Lunch was a sandwich prepared by a vulgar little
        gnome of a woman with intestinal troubles. The friendly
        barman who repeatedly filled my bottles told me she had
        eaten a dessert with too much creme anglaise the night
        before, and that was why she was spending so much time in
        the toilets. I avoided inspecting the woman&#146;s hands
        while I gnawed ravenously, and listened to the barman
        tell me about the area. Normally he worked collecting the
        oysters which were the little town&#146;s claim to fame.
        He just helped out his friend during the tourist season.
        During the winter, with the tourists all gone, he said,
        Ronce-les-Bains was like a ghost town, &quot;une ville
        fantome.&quot;</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Changing my tube and tire
        was more of an ordeal than I had anticipated, mostly due
        to the brand new tube being defective (the previous day,
        I had broken part of the stem off the other one,
        rendering it useless). When I finally pedaled off, it was
        straight against a brutal wind. The bridge across to
        Marennes provided a nice view of the oyster beds, yet it
        required all my energy just to keep the bike moving.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">On the other side of the
        bridge the terrain flattened out considerably. There were
        no more trees to protect cyclists from the wind, and the
        marshy canal-strewn landscape reminded me of Holland
        without the windmills. After several kilometers of
        near-futile pedaling, the fortified village of Brouage
        appeared, its walls towering majestically over the
        marshlands. It had been an important trading post for
        salt centuries ago, but now houses only a few old
        peasants and a couple of businesses catering to the
        occasional pink Brittanic. Brouage&#146;s cobblestone
        streets have the distinction of being the least
        bicycle-friendly I&#146;ve ever encountered. I stopped at
        a souvenir shop for an ice cream and pondered over
        whether Fred had or would make the same stop (he did, I
        learned later).</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The road onwards to
        Rochefort involved climbing a veryhigh bridge against the
        wind &#150;utter hell, but a terrific view at the top.
        The town billed itself as a &quot;new&quot; city, built
        in the 17<sup>th</sup> century as another military
        stronghold. Unusual for France, its streets are on a
        perfect grid. According to my guidebook, Rochefort is
        also known as &quot;the city of Pierre Loti.&quot; I rode
        on rue Pierre Loti past the Place Pierre Loti and the
        Maison Pierre Loti, all the time wondering if I&#146;d
        ever read anything by this apparently famous author. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">La Rochelle was still
        30-odd kilometers away, against the wind and on a busy
        road, so I decided to take a train. The ride in the
        little one-car conveyance took less than twenty minutes.
        I stood with my bike right behind the strikingly handsome
        conductor, who was telling a colleague how he worked as a
        film actor in between stints of driving his train. The
        tracks followed a string of beaches, and every time we
        passed a topless girl the conductor would toot his
        whistle. Once we arrived at the terminus, he helped me
        unload my bike and instructed me how to get to the center
        of town, where I found Fred waiting for me on the
        cathedral steps an hour before our appointed rendezvous.
        I was filled with relief that he had made it, and soon we
        were exchanging stories of our respective adventures and
