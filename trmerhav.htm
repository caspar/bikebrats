        <td><font face="Arial"><b>Merida to Havana, 20-24
        December</b></font><p><font size="2" face="Arial">It was
        raining when we woke up in Oxkutzcab, so we mayabed the
        remaining 100 kilometers into Merida, where we wasted no
        time getting hooked into the local queer scene (it cost
        me 4 backgammon units to get Fred to approach a smiley
        boy called Leonel who worked in a neighboring hotel) and
        overfamiliarize ourselves with Wannabuyahammock square.
        Merida is a lovely city that came as a shock after the
        poverty and simplicity of the Yucatecan hinterland.
        Arriving into town, we passed through a huge industrial
        sector that looked transplanted from the USA. It
        didn&#146;t take long for us to see that the parts of
        town where people live and shop were also neatly divided
        into highly segregated districts.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The center of town, just
        North of the zocalo, is the tourist ghetto. Our hotel was
        at the epicenter of this, located on Wannabuyahammock
        square, filled with aggressive street salesmen. The hotel
        itself was a total score. Aptly named the Gran Hotel, it
        has a decidedly special turn-of the century glamour. The
        rooms are all arranged around two vast balconies
        surrounding a central courtyard a floor below. We scored
        with our room, too, which was a kind of suite: a bedroom
        with a perfect god-sized bed, and a funky old bathroom
        separating it from the room we referred to as the
        &quot;yoga room&quot; &#150;a large, mostly empty space
        furnished only with a sofa and possessing a balcony
        overlooking the city&#146;s main street, calle 60. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Our time in Merida was
        spent accomplishing a variety of tasks attendant to
        long-term travel. Foremost among these was investigating
        the possibilities of flying from there to Havana, which
        turned out to be a more complicated process than we
        hoped, due to antediluvian technology, visa applications
        and the necessity of paying for everything in cash.
        Getting our laundry done proved equally frustrating, as
        did figuring out what Leonel was all about. Before taking
        us to what he claimed to be Merida&#146;s only queer bar
        on Saturday night, our sexy young host drove us up and
        down the flashy, Americanized Paseo Montejo, filled with
        upmarket restaurants and nightclubs, shopping malls, and
        drive-thru banks. The gay bar was an enormous open-air
        cavern of a place near the industrial part of town. We
        arrived just in time for the drag show, which took place
        on a vast stage adorned with cardboard and Reynolds Wrap.
        It was pretty much what one would expect, and not much
        different than Norma Jean&#146;s in Castroville.
        Shivering in the cold air and dead tired, we practically
        had to beg Leonel to take us back to our hotel.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Sunday is a big deal in
        Merida, at least in the touristic center, where they
        close the streets to traffic and set up stages everywhere
        for various cheesy musical acts. We thought that this was
        what all the locals did on Sunday until we ventured South
        of the tourist ghetto into the market district, which was
        absolutely thronged with manic shoppers. Here we found
        the real Merida that Leonel hadn&#146;t shown us. The
        covered part of the market was a fascinating place
        reminiscent of the pasars of Java; it seemed like one
        could obtain anything there, from birds to spare tractor
        parts. I was especially interested in the tortilla
        factory and its amazing industrial-age equipment; Fred
        liked the jewelry section. After a while, though, the
        crowds became too much to take, so we elbowed our way
        back to our hotel sanctuary. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Later we walked up to the
        archeology museum, which was closed. To amuse ourselves,
        we invited Leonel back to our room, but once he got there
        he played an elaborate game of &quot;I can&#146;t believe
        that you have lured me up here for sex.&quot; So it was
        just the two of us for dinner on the balcony of a pre-fab
        romantic restaurante overlooking calle 60, followed by a
        cheesy American flick (&quot;The Fan&quot;) and a
        fruitless junket to a nearby bar listed in the Spartacus
        guide. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Monday I woke up with a
        severe bout of malaise that was most likely motivated by
        the oppressive muggy weather and having nothing clean to
        wear. I felt trapped in Merida and wanted to get out.
        Fred helped me out of my funk, though, by insisting we
        walk once again up the Paseo Montejo, which the locals
        compare ad nauseum to the Champs Elysees. The museum was
        closed again, but a shopping mall catering to the middle
        classes was open. Fred got his hair shaved off while I
        waited in an endless line at a K-mart-like megastore to
        buy batteries for our walkman. The &quot;10 items or
        less&quot; aisle was a study in inefficiency. Just like
        everywhere else in Mexico, the cashier was unable to make
        change, and kept buzzing a collegue over to change a 20
        into two 10&#146;s. This same transaction took place with
        virtually every customer in the thirty-odd person line. I
        vowed I would never allow myself to feel vexed at Safeway
        again.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">We lunched at the Hyatt
        nearby &#150;mediocre food and worse service in a
        glacial, deserted cavern of a
        &quot;bistro&quot;&#151;before marching all the way back
        downtown to continue our ongoing dealings with travel
        arrangements and laundry. That evening Leonel surprised
        us by calling and setting up a late night date in a bar
        called Pancho&#146;s. When we arrived Leonel wasn&#146;t
        there, and after some table shuffling (Fred was
        understandably allergic to the cheesy band and its
        proximity) we gulped down some rather tasty &#145;ritas
        and alternately deconstructed the weirdness of
        Pancho&#146;s and hypothesized more on Leonel&#146;s
        mysterious motives. Pancho&#146;s is almost identical
        aesthetically and experientially to a yuppie Mexican
        restaurant in suburban America. The waiters were all
        dressed like Pancho Villa, complete with silly sombreros
        and cartridge bandoliers, and the decor was funky in a
        studied, vanilla sort of way. After another drink, we
        hoped Leonel wouldn&#146;t show up so we could sleep, but
        just as we were walking out the door he came rushing in
        saying he had been waiting for us outside &#150;typical,
        we figured, realizing we were stuck into another drink.
        But the margaritas had taken the edge off and Leonel
        seemed more bearable. When it was time to go, our Merida
        host suggested we get into his car. We thought we&#146;d
        just walk the block back to our hotel and turn in, but
        apparently Leonel had other ideas. &quot;Where do you
        want to go now?&quot; he asked. Fred moaned, but I was
        game: &quot;the Imperial Bar.&quot; Leonel pooh-poohed it
        as being for the lower classes, but I insisted, and we
        drove past to find it closed. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">It was here that Leonel
        surprised us, proving himself to be something other than
        the clueless, confused homo we had taken him for. He
        pulled a set of keys from his pocket and proposed we go
        to his friend&#146;s empty house. The casa in question
        was out in a new, flavorless suburb which reminded me
        again of Indonesia (my theory, which I&#146;ll try to
        develop more thoroughly some day, is that Mexico and
        Indonesia are the same country): a cookie cutter house on
        a cookie cutter street. The decor was minimal, but what
        there was, was of highly dubious taste. Leonel explained
        that the house belonged to a queer cousin (que familia!)
        who lived with his parents like any good unmarried
        Mexican boy, but kept this house for assignations. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">We didn&#146;t tarry long
        examining the decor, though. It would have been more fun
        had there not been so many mosquitos.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The next day was devoted
        mostly to getting our asses to Cuba. It was one of those
        connective, logistical days that are essential in any
        long or complicated voyage. First we had to scrape
        together the cash for the travel agent in Leonel&#146;s
        hotel, which wasn&#146;t so easy since it surpassed our
        atm limit. As expected, cash advances on our French visa
        cards took a while &#150;but not as long as our search
        for bicycle boxes (there weren&#146;t any at the airport,
        reported our travel agent with an enervating smile).
        Under a nasty gray sky, breathing the poisonous,
        temperature-inverted air, we made our way through the
        throngs to a bike shop in the market area, where the only
        bike box they kept was for a child&#146;s model.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">--So we opted for an oven
        box and a fridge box for an appliance store instead. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Fred&#146;s job of
        confecting a suitable box for both of our bicycles from
        what looked like bits of cardboard was a sight to behold;
        Olivier would have been proud of what Fred dubbed
        &quot;Frankenbox.&quot; The task was performed in the
        yoga room, and it took a serious while. I helped, mostly
        by fetching more tape and providing moral support. There
        were a couple of moments, though, when we&#146;d look at
        each other hopelessly, thinking: what the hell are we
        doing? Are we totally nuts?</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">But everything ended up
        working beautifully. When the time came to leave for the
        airport, I found a friendly and understanding taxi driver
        with a perfectly-sized rack on the top of his car. After
        checking in at the airport, a young and scruffy American
        guy stopped us and we talked to him for an hour or so.
        His name is Fielder and he had biked from Merida to Tikal
        (taking the bus back) on a 25-year-old ten-speed, with no
        map, no water bottles, and no cycling gear whatsoever. We
        also met an older American dude from Sacramento who was
        on our flight and who was working on the construction of
        an American embassy-like building in Havana. It was his
        first time, there, too, but he was taking it in stride,
        obviously an old travel pro.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Landing in Cuba went
        pretty much as expected. From the plane Havana looked
        almost totally dark; what lights there were were very low
        wattage. The terminal was basically a Quonset hut, full
        of employees who didn&#146;t seem to be doing much. Fred
        found a friendly and helpful young woman who went to look
        to see if our bikes had arrived (there was no point in
        waiting if they hadn&#146;t). Amazingly, she came back
        with good news. The box looked bad but not terrible, and
        as we plunged out of customs into the Cuban night
        &#150;miracle of miracles&#151;the first taxi driver we
        encountered had a van! He wanted $25 but we were hardly
        in a position to argue.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">We couldn&#146;t see much
        on the way into town, partly due to the general obscurity
        but mostly because of the driver&#146;s outrageously
        inappropriate speed. What we did see was charming,
        though: a crumbling, elegant city that looks like a
        tropical East Berlin. Plus lots and lots of bicycles. All
        of the motorized vehicles &#150;with the glaring
        exception of our van&#151;were ancient, decrepit and
        moving at a snail&#146;s pace.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">We pulled to a screeching
        halt in front of the Hotel Presidente, where the first
        impression was aural rather than visual. A fantastic band
        was playing sexy mambo music on the terrace and another
        band was playing tired standards in the dingy lobby. The
        staff buzzed all around us, fascinated by our enormous,
        mysterious box and our odd accouterments.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">We didn&#146;t dare open
        the abused box until we got into our decidedly
        unglamorous room. Another great surprise: they were
        intact. Fred was intent on assembling them right away
        under the 20-watt bulb. By that time it was past midnight
        and time to check out the music and the local beer. The
        former definitely outshone the latter, and the ambiance
        at the bar was creepy &#150;desperate-looking, aggressive
        whores and a couple of drunken, jaded customers,
        presumably from Eastern Europe.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">We chose to enjoy our bad
        Cuban beer and awesome panini on the terrace, where the
        music stopped almost as soon as we got there, to replaced
        by the sound of crickets and the occasional 50&#146;s era
        car motor. Two creepy dudes invited themselves to our
        table and went through the usual sleazebag routine,
        asking us how much I&#146;d paid for my watch, commenting
        on our footwear, proposing &quot;nice black girls&quot;
        and finally a walk around the neighborhood (no thank
        you). It was Christmas eve. We went to bed eagerly
        anticipating Cuba by daylight, just like kids wondering
        what Santa had left under the tree.</font></p>
