        Akko, 25km (a)</b></font><p><font size="2" face="Arial">For
        a long time now, I&#146;ve been anticipating our arrival
        in the Middle East with a mixture of excitement and
        dread. Media-driven fears of danger, as well as countless
        people&#146;s warnings to us contributed to the fear part
        of this equation. And the bomb threat hadn&#146;t helped
        any, either.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Was it an augury or just
        an odd coincidence that it corresponded with our first
        foray into the Wonderful World of Islam? In either case,
        it happened over a month ago, on our way to Istanbul. Our
        Greek taxi driver, driving us to Athens airport, gave us
        the usual spiel: &quot;Hwhy hyou go to Turkey? There is
        nothing to see there, and the people are terrible.&quot;
        I told him we were meeting my family there, which
        placated him somewhat. After the usual airport hassles we
        were on a bus leading us to our Turkish Airlines plane.
        Without any warning, the bus came to a sudden halt,
        screeched its tires as it turned around, and dumped us
        back at the gate, where we were rejoined by the first
        busload of passengers, who had been evacuated from the
        plane. No one would tell us what was going on for six
        hours, during which time we were herded from one holding
        area to another. The departure time listed on the
        electronic board kept moving further and further into the
        future. We began to wonder if we should have taken the
        train to Istanbul. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Finally we were assigned
        another departure gate. Just as the airline staff began
        to load us into buses, the reason for the delay was
        disclosed: &quot;Ladies and gentlemen, we apologize for
        this delay, but at 9:30 this morning a bomb threat was
        called in and we had to check the aircraft. We hope
        you&#146;ll understand and wish you a pleasant
        flight.&quot; Fred and I looked at each other with
        shocked expressions. Why hadn&#146;t they told us it was
        a bomb in the first place? --to keep butts in the seats?
        The happy chatter surrounding us on our first trip out to
        the plane was replaced with a nervous silence. The bus
        went much further this time, out to a far-flung area of
        the airport full of uniformed men with guns, fire trucks
        and ambulances. All in all, a sobering sight. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Aboard, the atmosphere
        remained palpably tense, especially at take-off. A couple
        across the aisle from us &#150;Californians on their way
        to Turkey to celebrate their anniversary&#151;clung to
        each other during the whole flight. A young British
        archeologist sitting next to us distracted us with photos
        of her last trip to Turkey. I looked out the window,
        searching for familiar geographical features. The
        Dardenelles soon opened to the Sea of Marmara. Then we
        were descending, thankful for the flight&#146;s brevity.
        When the plane landed, many of the passengers burst into
        spontaneous applause. Flight 228 to hell had made it in
        one piece. But the incident made me wary of Middle
        Eastern politics and its often deadly ramifications&#133;</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Fortunately, no one
        hijacked the Nissos Kypros on our journey from Cyprus to
        Haifa. At immigrations in Limassol, we met an English
        cyclist called Declan and two young Canadians, Andrey and
        Erin. The guy stamping Fred&#146;s passport recognized
        him from the scene he made the week before. I
        couldn&#146;t help but wonder if Fred Felman had become
        somewhat of a legend on the old vessel. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Once aboard, we were
        delighted to find ourselves upgraded to a better cabin
        (perhaps the staff was afraid of Fred), but left it
        immediately in search of Declan. He had been cycling in
        Jordan and Israel and I was anxious to hear what he had
        to say about it.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Tall and blond, Declan has
        a very calm air to him, like a Buddhist monk or
        something. He was traveling alone with astonishingly
        little gear, all of which fit into a small shoulder bag.
        Out of this he pulled a couple of maps, which I fell upon
        like a vulture. I didn&#146;t have any maps of the Middle
        East, and had no idea of a route. Declan showed us where
        he&#146;d been, up the King&#146;s Highway in Jordan,
        which included &quot;hills where I really thought I was
        going to die&quot;, and on into Israel. He recommended
        the road along the Dead Sea and told us to avoid
        Nazareth, a town he dismissed in his northern England
        accent as &quot;a doomp.&quot;</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">After this debriefing, I
        accepted Erin and Andrey&#146;s invitation to share their
        bottle of vodka out on deck, where the air was still
        deliciously balmy. Both of them young Canadians living in
        London, they had planned on flying to Dubrovnik, but
        missed their plane at Gatwick, where they changed their
        plans entirely once they found a cheap flight to Cyprus.
        I admired their spontaneity and their
        American-I-mean-North-American-style candor. Erin told us
        how she had saved a woman who had tried to hang herself
        from a tree back in Toronto, and Andre showed us his
        groovy little digital camera and told us of his own
        travel web site, roam.org. Declan and Fred came along and
        helped us polish off the bottle, and we all talked into
        the wee hours.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The ship wasn&#146;t
        supposed to arrive until past eight, but I found myself
        being roused at the crack of dawn. &quot;We&#146;re
        there,&quot; said Fred, &quot;we&#146;re in Haifa.&quot;
        My brain filled with fuzz, I hauled my ass out of my bunk
        into the exhaust-filled car deck, where our bikes had
        spent the night. Rolling down the plank, we were directed
        to customs and security check by one of those
        off-puttingly youthful female security officers, cute as
        buttons but deadly serious. Yes, we were in Israel, all
        right. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Declan was the only person
        we saw at first in the holding area. He told us that
        they&#146;d taken his bike and all of his stuff, and that
        we&#146;d soon be subjected to similar indignities. After
        a long wait, another Israeli teenybopper strode up to us,
        asked a few questions, and let us proceed to immigration.
        Declan was beside himself. How come he had to wait and we
        didn&#146;t? He pointed to our saddles and asked the
        security babe how she&#146;d like to sit on that for five
        weeks like he had. Fred and I figured that this sort of
        tactic wasn&#146;t going to get him through any more
        quickly. While waiting for the immigrations dude to
        peruse our passports, Fred told me how he&#146;d
        &quot;played the Jew card&quot; with the security girl
        while I was in the toilet, thereby facilitating our
        entrance into the Jewish State. When she asked him if he
        had any family here, he answered, &quot;probably,&quot;
        thus earning instant security clearance. As Fred
        recounted this tale, the terrifying &quot;thump&quot; of
        a passport stamp brought us back into the present tense.
        They had stamped Fred&#146;s passport with the dreaded
        Israeli visa. I resigned myself to the fact that this
        simplified my task of creating an itinerary for us.
        &quot;I guess that means we won&#146;t be going to Syria
        now,&quot; I said. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Haifa was just waking up
        as we pedaled along the gritty port, dazed and hungry. We
        stopped in a sleazy little kiosk for breakfast. The place
        was run by friendly Moroccans who spoke to us in French
        and insisted we use their kitchen to change into our
        biking gear. When I had to change my tire, the man
        wouldn&#146;t let me leave until I had thoroughly
        scrubbed my hands. I found myself liking his almost
        parental concern. We had obviously left the hostility of
        the Greeks far behind us&#133;</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">After several kilometers
        of pumping through one of the uglier industrial
        wastelands I&#146;ve ever laid eyes upon, another bike
        shot down from above (Haifa is organized vertically up a
        mountain called Karmel) and into the rightmost lane in
        front of us. Curious to see who else would brave such a
        dreadful road, we caught up with him for a butt-sniff,
        and learned he was on his way to his furniture shop, just
        down the road. Would we like to join him for a cup of
        coffee?</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">While the coffee never
        appeared (I am sensitive to such things) Ami was very
        informative on possible routes through the Holy Land,
        though more than a little biased. &quot;Don&#146;t take
        that road,&quot; he would say, &quot;it goes through Arab
        villages.&quot; He also advised us strongly against
        cycling through Jordan or the West Bank. When we told him
        we were on our way to Akko, an Arab town, he cringed. Ami
        did invite us to a biking event along the Dead Sea,
        however, and he told me where to find a decent map, in a
        nearby mall that was the scariest place I&#146;ve been
        this side of Atlanta. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The road to Akko was
        relentlessly hideous, choked with truck exhaust and lined
        with strip malls and chemical plants. It made me thankful
        that I wasn&#146;t born in suburban Israel, though we
        both appreciated the first &quot;Burger King&quot; sign
        we&#146;d seen in a long time, a comforting slice of
        Americana in the scariness of the Middle East. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Akko is one of the more
        ancient ports in the world, and as atmospheric a place as
        our bikes have taken us. Once we penetrated its ancient
        walls it was as if we&#146;d stepped through a time warp.
        The ages-old souk was teeming with life, full of lurid
        colors, unfamiliar smells and exotically-clad locals
        chattering loudly in Arabic to compete with the call of
        the muezzin. We had to stop for a few moments to soak it
        all in.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Finding a place was easy
        enough. Our host Anwar was friendly and accommodating.
        Leaving the bikes in the dining area was &quot;no
        problem&quot; &#150;a refreshing attitude after Cyprus.
        The remainder of the day was spent playing tourist,
        walking along the tremendously fortified walls and
        visiting the Crusaders city, now buried under more modern
        layers of Akko. Fred aptly likened the whole town to filo
        dough, built up upon countless layers of history. Many of
        Akko&#146;s narrow streets are covered and vaulted, and
        all are full of garbage, cats and scruffy little kids.
        Its golden era long since forgotten, Akko nevertheless
        retains an aura of mystery and intrigue like no place
        we&#146;ve been so far; not at all what I normally
        picture when I think of Israel, and therefore testimony
        to this new-old country&#146;s incredible richness, as
        well as its resistance to pigeonholing. </font></p>

        <td><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>3 November, Akko to
        Ginosar, 56km (f)</b></font><p><font size="2" face="Arial">Andrew stated that his biggest worry in
        Israel was that I&#146;d be struck by Jew in Homeland
        Syndrome. He&#146;d seen so many of his Jewish friends go
        off to a kibbutz and come back ragingly religious and now
        wondered if I&#146;d fall under the spell of the holy
        land. I&#146;d dismissed the idea summarily, everything
        I&#146;d heard about the place told me that I could
        hardly travel there much less live here. Admittedly the
        magic of the first day nearly won me over. We&#146;d been
        granted such a wonderful welcome. This was, after all,
        the first place where my religious background got me
        through customs faster than normal.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Our goodbye to Akko was
        encapsulated in a little lecture we got from our hotelier
        Anwar. I think there was a moral to the little discussion
        but it was hard to find. It might have been that hatred
        is bad and harmony is good, the U.S. is war mongering or
        that he prefers frosted to corn flakes. I am not sure how
        we escaped his ramblings, but I am glad that we did, even
        though it was raining sporadically. Luck was with us;
        once we set out nary a drop fell on us on the way.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The main highway to
        Tiberias was a beautiful four lane affair with no traffic
        and an enormous shoulder. Each bus stop was full of
        teenage soldiers toting M16&#146;s hitching rides. The
        girls seemed to have the best luck getting picked up.
        Andy and I both admitted finding the girls with guns sexy
        and the boys scary. Lunar rocky landscape bordered the
        road broken by occasional groves of olive and pine.
        Villages set back from the road were ugly cement blocks
        and I counted it as good fortune that we didn&#146;t have
        to ride through them.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">We turned off the main
        road in favor of a calmer one just in front of a roadside
        falafel stand and lunched with yet more gun toting youths
        (GTY&#146;s). The break came just after a grueling hill
        that brought us to nearly 400 meters above sea level
        where we started. This would be our first day ever,
        starting from the ocean, where we would have a net
        descent for the day. The sea of Galilee sits 200 meters
        below sea level. The one happy thought I carried with me
        as I nearly barfed up my pita climbing the last hundred
        meters is that there would be a hell of a downhill
        somewhere.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Unfortunately the first
        meters of our descent were of the hand-maiming,
        perilously steep and highly trafficked variety. Once we
        finally cleared the big village and curvy streets the
        road opened up and so did we. I love the sound of my rear
        hub&#146;s bearings whizzing as the wind buffets my face.
        On the way we passed Arab school children waiting for
        busses and playing in the street. Many of them were
        engaged in some form of violence against one another,
        slapping, hitting, throwing stones and shouting. They
        shouted at us as we passed and one even tossed a very
        small stone at my front wheel.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Before long we had found
        the lake and were riding along looking for our tourist
        attraction du jour. The ancient boat of Galilee was found
        ten years ago in the tidal waters of the lake and was now
        being documented and restored. Dishonest tour guides told
        the unsuspecting travelers that it was Jesus&#146; boat.
        We went down to see the boat before seeing the movie and
        found Jerome Hall, an American, working diligently on
        her. Jerome told us later that a tourist nun had asked
        him for a little chunk of the boat upon hearing that her
        savior had ridden in it.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Jerome had been hired to
        document the boat and was in the process of putting
        little numbered pieces of tape every five centimeters
        upon her withering hull so they could use a laser
        something-or-other to aid in the process of
        documentation. We found Jerome suspended in a gondola
        over the boat in a refrigerated room toiling away. Jerome
        would prove to be our best ally over the next days.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Somehow, while seeing the
        boat and movie about her it had become nearly dark. We
        decided we&#146;d have to find a place to stay nearby to
        avoid riding in the now dusky light. We had two choices
        within a few meters of the boat. The Kibbutz Inn or the
        Kibbutz Hotel were our choices and we chose the cheaper,
        more rustic and infinitely more interesting Kibbutz Inn.
        As a young Jew in America I&#146;d managed to avoid the
        kibbutz experience, now was my chance to live it
        vicariously. Jerome escorted us over to the office where
        we paid for our room and made a rendezvous for dinner
        with Jerome. He&#146;d agreed to show us around and take
        us to the bomb shelter-housed disco for a little
        down-home entertainment. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The dining room at the
        kibbutz was a cross between &quot;One Flew Over the
        Cuckoo&#146;s Nest&quot; and the foreign exchange
        students cafeteria in a college dorm. The sprawling room
        had but a few middle-aged kibbutzniks eating alone at
        huge tables talking to themselves and three tables full
        of strapping European youths who volunteer as slave labor
        at the kibbutz. One other faction worth mention was the
        group of contract workers from Thailand who kept to
        themselves. The Thais are imported in to farm bananas,
        and are found all over Israel. The volunteers welcomed us
        warmly and Jerome told us of the intricacies of kibbutz
        life.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Before the disco we went
        over to the hotel for a beer where Jerome filled us in
        more on his life in Israel. The kibbutzniks are fiercely
        independent lot. Most won&#146;t even acknowledge Jerome
        on the kibbutz. The ones that do are the outcasts. The
        volunteers come mostly from Europe and are rarely of
        Jewish decent (at least on this kibbutz). They make a
        hefty ten shekels a day and live in squalid dorm room
        conditions. The volunteers do have an active social life
        that centers around their disco and pub.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Jerome warned us that you
        couldn&#146;t fart in your room at the kibbutz without
        the entire 800 residents knowing about it within a few
        moments. Case in point was the story of the two Dutch
        volunteers exploits the day before their departure for a
        little vacation. Consistently everyone told us we should
        avoid playing pool in the volunteers&#146; pub and we
        should be especially careful of the dreaded
        &quot;12&quot; ball. Apparently Jonah and Mike got more
        than a little drunk and decided to play the game naked,
        driving the more modest 10-shekle-a-day laborers from the
        bar and to their bunks. Even the stout-hearted ones left
        promptly when Jonah expressed his desire to put one of
        the balls where the sun doesn&#146;t shine. Aided by Mike
        who wielded a cue-stick, the ball disappeared. Night we
        made it out to the pub a young handsome Swede
        demonstrated that the only way to handle the dreaded
        implement of Jonah&#146;s desire was with a ladle
        pilfered from the cafeteria. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The disco proved to be
        less entertaining, but not without interest. Now that
        Israel has had a relatively long peace thanks to Rabin
        (no thanks to Netanyahu) the bomb shelter near the
        cafeteria is only used for the volunteer&#146;s dancing
        pleasure. They descend twice each week into an abyss of
        black light and wailing music to forget their week&#146;s
        work. Surprisingly few of the kibbutz members made it
        down. We proceeded our visit with a stop at the hotel bar
        to share a few beers with Jerome. By the time we got
        there Jerome had loosened up and was telling us all of
        the need-to-know facts of kibbutz life. He was anxious
        for us to meet Gumpel, the one kibbutz member who was a
        disco regular. An audiophile and dancing madman, Gumpel
        shook his funky groove-thing for all. Conversation with
        Gumpel was impossible, first because the music was so
        loud and, second, because Gumpel&#146;s ears were stuffed
        with cotton. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Our stay at the kibbutz
        was no bargain. Our claustrophobic room set us back more
        shekels than any room in the previous three countries.
        There was no room the second night so we were prepared to
        leave, but the raging rain storm pinned us down. Jerome
        stepped in and was good enough to share his room with us.
        It all worked out well until the kibbutz staff realized
        the next day we&#146;d stayed without paying. The aging
        deaf desk clerk berated us when he learned we had stayed.
        He and the kibbutz mafia tried to extract more shekels
        out of us then we had paid the previous night. We refused
        until they came back with a more reasonable offer.</font></p>

        Neve Eitan, 84km (a)</b></font><p><font size="2" face="Arial">The skies looked slightly less threatening
        today, so we set off, hastily deciding to take the long
        way towards the south, all the way along the Sea of
        Galilee (actually a lake). Jerome and others had told us
        that the Jesus-oriented sites on the lake&#146;s north
        shore were must-sees. Capernaum, supposed site of the
        house of Saint Peter, disappointed us, however, a sorry
        excuse for a couple of souvenir stands and yet another
        opportunity for American pilgrims to throw themselves
        into religious ecstasy. Signs at the entrance informed us
        that visitors needed to be wearing long pants, so we
        donned our dorky-looking rain pants since they were the
        most accessible. Other tourists must have wondered what
        weird sect we belonged to that called for such unusual
        matching outfits.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">More satisfying was the
        hyrax we saw scampering into some bushes. Allegedly a
        cousin of the elephant, it looked more like a woodchuck
        or an agouti to us. Not too long out of Capernaum we
        crossed a river and entered the Golan Depths &#150;I
        figured we&#146;d view the more famous Heights from
        below--, territory seized from Syria in the Six Days War
        of 1967 and annexed by Israel shortly thereafter. I
        thought about how close we were to Syria and the
        implications of the brewing conflict between the US and
        Iraq, and as if on cue the mountains above echoed with
        the unmistakable sounds of mortar blasts. Huge plumes of
        smoke rose from the side of a slope directly above us,
        and I told myself that it must be a simple drill on a
        firing range. A little further we passed a sort of
        parking lot for tanks, but restrained ourselves from
        taking any photos, not in the mood to argue with any
        teenagers toting AK-47s. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The road here was
        beautiful, mostly following the coastline of the lake,
        occasionally climbing to give us amazing views. From one
        such vantage point we watched a storm batter the other
        shore, proceeding rapidly in our direction. Thankfully we
        found shelter in an abandoned beach pavilion, where we
        hung out for an hour or so while the storm passed over
        us. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">When the rain stopped we
        got back on our bikes &#150;a big mistake, since the sky
        opened up shortly thereafter. Never had we ridden in such
        rain; it was like swimming underwater. While we probably
        rode less than a kilometer to the first shelter (an empty
        guard shack at the entrance to a kibbutz), the
        apocalyptic downpour had totally soaked us. Demoralized
        by the deluge, I began to think about alternatives to
        biking through the Middle East. We could ditch the bikes
        in Tel Aviv and drive or bus through Jordan and Egypt; or
        we could just take the Nissos Kypros back to Athens and
        head home a month earlier than planned&#133;</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Fortunately, the rain
        subsided before I could develop these ideas any further.
        And a roadside falafel improved my mood tremendously. I
        still hadn&#146;t decided on an itinerary for our plan
        southwards, whether we&#146;d ride into Tel Aviv or not,
        where we&#146;d cross into Jordan, etc, etc. Our initial
        plan was to head up to a nature reserve and hostel near a
        place called Avula (we referred to it as
        &quot;arugula&quot;), but neither of us had the will to
        push up any big hills, so we checked out Beit
        She&#146;an. The town&#146;s situation at one of the
        three border crossings between Jordan and Israel seemed
        serendipitous. We could ditch our bikes here (thereby
        avoiding any unnecessary inclines), make a quick tour by
        bus to Tel Aviv and Jerusalem, and cross into Jordan from
        here a few days hence. Of course, that&#146;s not the way
        it worked out, but it seemed a good idea at the time. And
        Pessie, the woman who managed the kibbutz we stayed at,
        was amenable to all of our ideas. She could keep the
        bikes &quot;no problem&quot;, and even called her friend
        who worked at the border &#150;only a couple of
        kilometers away&#151;to see if we could bring our bikes
        into the kingdom of Jordan. A heavily accented &quot;no
        problem&quot; was her answer once again; we were sold,
        even though the place was a dump (and an overpriced one
        at that). Surrounded by barbed wire and mired in mud,
        Kibbutz Neve Eitan looked all but abandoned, just a
        collection of forlorn concrete shoe boxes reminiscent of
        a circa 1960 self storage facility. Pessie explained that
        the kibbutz had only 100 members now, and rented out most
        of the housing to newly-arrived immigrants. Sure enough,
        on my quest for a garden hose to rinse off our muddy
        bikes, I ran into an obvious Russian dude working on his
        rusty old car.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">I changed my mind in
        regards to itinerary on my way up the nasty hill into
        town, in search of dinner. I thought Plan A would work
        out fine if it rained again tomorrow, but if the sun was
        shining it would really be more fun to ride through the
        West Bank and check out Jericho, recently granted
        Palestinian autonomy and the lowest city on the planet.
        When I came back with our meal &#150;still more
        falafel&#151;Fred had already packed his bag for the bus
        ride, and was clearly displeased with my indecisiveness.
        A beer, dinner, and the &quot;X-files&quot; on t.v.
        brought him around, though. As per usual, he was putty in
        my hands itinerary-wise, my idea of the perfect traveling
        companion. <i>(Andy&#146;s itinerary was later putty in
        the Jordanian border official&#146;s hands&#133;. - F)</i></font></p>

        to Jericho/Jerusalem, 86 km (f)</b></font><p><font size="2" face="Arial">The sun was shining and I was again
        in love with riding. About ten kilometers into our ride
        my heart left my chest. Huge signs declared that there
        was a check point ahead. The sign was correct for soon we
        saw gun turrets, barbed wire and armored vehicles on the
        horizon. The last billboard before the checkpoint
        declared that &quot;no individual tourists allowed in the
        west bank&quot;. I envisioned turning around and going
        back to Neve Eitan. As we passed into the checkpoint, as
        if to underscore my every fear, the guards motioned for
        us to approach them and said, &quot;Come and talk to
        us.&quot;</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Immediately I realized it
        was a different scenario altogether when they pulled out
        a bottle of coke and a few filthy glasses and offered us
        some. One had bicycled extensively after his three years
        of service in the military and truly was interested in
        our bike trip. He gave us council and advice and
        demonstrated the &quot;blow-your-f***cking-head-off&quot;
        caliber machine gun. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">We were waved on and soon
        found ourselves amongst the friendly Palestinians.
        Children waved and shouted at us. Cyclists raced to catch
        up with us and ride along with us. It was the first time
        since the USA that I&#146;d felt that welcome riding
        anywhere. It was shocking to find everyone so friendly
        after we&#146;d been warned about how &quot;dangerous the
        Arabs&quot; are by many Israelis. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">After a few hours we
        entered Jericho, the &quot;oldest continuously inhabited
        city of the world&quot; according to the signage. Proud
        Palestinian soldiers and police stood underneath their
        flag guarding their border and city. Entering the old
        town we were accosted by virulent souvenir hawkers who
        somehow convinced us to buy &quot;Arafat&quot; hats at
        exorbitant prices. Before long we reached the old town
        and scarfed a few falafels while a little boy donned
        Andy&#146;s helmet and tried to convince us that it was a
        gift. One kind young man escorted us to the taxi stand
        and helped us negotiate a trip to Jerusalem. By cabbing
        it to Fanatic City we&#146;d avoid riding up a dangerous
        highway at sunset and ascending over 1000 meters. Our
        ride took us just short of the city on the hill. The last
        three kilometers convinced me we&#146;d made the right
        decision. The drivers were as fanatical as the religious
        zealots. Tired and ill prepared for finding a hotel we
        floundered searching for a place to stay. We settled
        finally at the plush YMCA. Its deco-arabesque halls were
        our home for the next days.</font></p>

        and singing a few choruses of the Village People&#146;s
        famous song (of course while pantomiming the spelling of
        the acronym) in the lobby we hit the town. Andy
        remembered a quarter of the new city that housed walk
        streets, pubs and restaurants so we headed directly
        there. Unable to find the queer bar he&#146;d remembered
        from his past visit we stumbled into the hippest bar we
        could find. Overrun by teenage American bimbos and sultry
        Israeli teenagers it was just a little too much to
        handle. We&#146;d actually been lured in by the
        two-for-one deal they&#146;d advertised, thinking that we
        would each have a beer and go. There was only one problem
        when the bill came. They had charged us for two beers.
        Andrew&#146;s WASPish parsimony alarm went. We argued
        that we had ordered the two beers during happy hour and
        expected to pay for one. The barmaid explained that we
        had missed the fine print and that we were entitled to a
        second beer each for no extra charge, but would have to
        pay for two. Indulging our BikeBrats signature
        &quot;waste-not-want-not&quot; sensibility we without
        hesitation ordered our second beer.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Having consumed two beers
        and ridden in the midday sun we found it easier to head
        back to our hotel than walk in the old city. That would
        have to wait for the next day. We did have one very
        important stop on the way to the &quot;Y&quot;. A
        friendly little all-night-grocery with an astounding
        selection of Ben and Jerry&#146;s ice cream bars. I slept
        soundly with visions of Cherry Garcia in dark chocolate
        dancing in my head.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">A sunny cool and windy day
        greeted us the next morning. We got an early start and
        headed for fanatic city. Intending to begin the day with
        a benign walk on the city walls we were disappointed to
        find that the attraction was not yet open for the day.
        Instead we headed directly for the epicenter of Jewish
        fanaticism &#150; the western wall. Entering the site was
        not unlike getting on an airplane. Metal detectors and
        x-ray machines were employed to determine if we had any
        menacing weapons. Once inside we figured that we were
        nearly the only unarmed folks in the place. Police and
        soldiers swarmed amongst the faithful and occasionally
        there was an intersection between the two groups. Several
        pistol-toting prayers were huddled at the wall.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The area in front of the
        wall is reserved for those engaged in prayer. A section
        on the right is for girls and the left for boys. On the
        men&#146;s side a talmudic scholar was studying in the
        fierce morning sun. As he read an American couple quietly
        motioned to one another, stood on the barrier and took a
        video over his shoulder. &quot;Look Bob, he&#146;s
        actually reading Hebrew,&quot; she seemed to say.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Andy and I decided to go
        in for a closer look grabbing cardboard kippahs and
        heading for the wall. Two meters into the area while
        snapping photos Andrew (strangely not me&#133;) was
        accosted by a black caped and hatted dude who looked like
        father time. He asked him in German if he was Jewish.
        &quot;No,&quot; he replied, &quot;but he is,&quot;
        pointing to me. A minute later tfillim had been
        &quot;bound for frontlets between my eyes&quot; and upon
        my arm and I was reading the Viahafta with our new rabbi
        friend. All the while Andy was snapping photos wildy.
        While I unbound myself and said a mourner&#146;s kaddish
        for my dad Andy was becoming the belle of the ball of the
        wailing wall. He&#146;d met another rabbi who took him
        into the room where they store torahs and other books,
        then showed him he was hiding a tracheotomy tube under
        his beard and appealed to his charity. On the way out of
        the holy site Andy came upon an idea for a photo essay --
        &quot;Fred&#146;s fabulous path through fanatic
        city.&quot; He&#146;d capture me engaging in the ritual
        of the three primary religions in Jerusalem. I
        wasn&#146;t sure what all it would entail, but I agreed
        and we set out to see more of the city.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">From the wailing wall we
        wanted to ascend the city walls and make our way from the
        Dung Gate to the Damascus Gate atop the fortifications.
        It turned out that there was no way to mount the walls
        legitimately near the wailing wall, so we climbed around
        a barricade and went up anyway. We figured we&#146;d pay
        for the attraction when we reached Jaffa Gate. It
        surprise me that we were in competition with no one as we
        made our way there. When we arrived at our goal we found
        that there was no exit, and that this sector of the walls
        were closed. We faced having to backtrack or find another
        way down. Craftily we climbed down into the courtyard of
        a museum without anyone being the wiser.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">As planned we now bought a
        ticket and headed for the Moslem quarter. When we reached
        the Damascus gate we were shocked by the rush of humanity
        entering the city through the gate. Many of which were
        wearing full Moslem regalia including dishrags and robes.
        Which brings us to an important point. Throughout our
        trip through Israel to this moment we&#146;d
        distinguished people as &quot;pot holders&quot; (those
        wearing kippah) and &quot;non-potholders&quot;. In Old
        Jerusalem almost every Jew had a pot holder or some type
        of head covering. In fact, almost everyone of every
        religious sect or another aside from (and sometimes
        including tourists) was wearing some form of religious
        drag. Jews in ridiculous black suits and sidelocks,
        Moslems in dishrags and robes (or chadors for the
        females) and Christians in whole ranges of different
        silly outfits. The Christians get the prize for the most
        hilarious ones. Some in sack cloth, nuns in cone-head
        outfits and Orthodox priests wearing more gold than the
        Pope decorated the streets of the city. All of this led
        us to tag Jerusalem the &quot;fanatic city.&quot;</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Over the Arabs flooding
        the old town Israeli soldiers stood guard with their
        machine guns. One seemed about to fall asleep as he
        watched over the faithful coming to pray. This day,
        Friday, is the most important one for both the Jews and
        the Arabs. Now the faithful Moslems were on their way to
        the temple for the all-important midday prayer.
        Consequently heathens like us were not allowed to see the
        mosques so we headed for Via Dolorosa. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Nearly our first, and by
        far the most tumultuous stop was the church that marked
        (I think) where Jesus began his march to be crucified. In
        the courtyard an industrious young camera-toting Arab had
        brought an enormous cross that tourists could sling over
        their should and pose with for a fee. Andy asked me to
        grab it and smile for the camera as his owner said in a
        quiet voice &quot;don&#146;t touch the cross.&quot; I
        acted as though I did not hear him and all seemed well
        until he ran over to us and tried to take our camera. I
        snatched the backpack from him and said, mistakenly,
        &quot;f*** you.&quot; This caused the end of the world in
        his eyes. He was speechless with anger and shock. We took
        advantage of his paralysis and ducked into the chapel to
        figure out a game plan while he mustered his forces
        outside. I was hoping to find another exit from within
        the chapel, but was disappointed to discover that the
        only way out was past our pissed-off friend. Fight and
        flight both seeming impossible options, I collected my
        wits and tried to soothe the savage beast. I explained
        that I didn&#146;t hear him warn me about the cross and
        thought that it belonged to the church. I was &quot;sorry
        that I touched his cross.&quot; Furthermore, I was
        enraged that he would try to take something of mine, my
        camera, and understood and empathized with his anger over
        the cross. He too should understand and empathize with my
        anger over the camera. After all, it was just a big
        misunderstanding and we should just shake hands and go on
        with our day. I offered my hand, he accepted and I walked
        out of the church a little shaken and surprised that it
        was that easy to escape that situation.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Our next stop would be the
        Church of the Holy Sepulcher. A huge and strange
        structure that looks as though it was decorated by a
        schizophrenic. First built by St. Catherine it houses the
        holiest places of the various sects of the Christian
        religions. Simultaneously managed by these sects it feels
        more like a Halloween maze than a church. The holy sites
        within the church were identified by visions and are not
        confirmed absolutely in the historical sense. Andy
        photographed furiously as I ran the gauntlet through the
        church, kissing, touching and praying at various places
        in the shrine. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">At one spot I stepped out
        of queue to have a look at a fabulous gold encrusted
        mosaic. It was in a microscopic chapel within the church
        that housed and even smaller chapel inside, supposedly
        marking the exact spot of Christ&#146;s tomb. We were
        just about to enter the smallest chapel. As I was about
        to rejoin Andy in line a huffy busy-body tour guide
        accused me of trying to jump the line in front of him.
        Feeling very holy and mighty from our day&#146;s tourism
        I reminded him that this was a holy site and that he
        should watch his tone or step outside much to the
        embarrassment of his German patrons who bid him to shut
        up.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">All of this religious
        drama exhausted me. I couldn&#146;t wait to get the heck
        out of Old Jerusalem. We made our way back to the hotel
        for a nap. That night we decided that we needed a stiff
        dose of Americana and decided to see a movie. Air Force
        One seemed just the ticket. We took a taxi to the movie
        finding it in a nasty little shopping mall. The
        refreshing thing about the experience was that in
        contrast to the afternoon we didn&#146;t see a single pot
        holder. It was a relief to be away from religious
        zealotry. We joined the throng of cell phone toting
        Israelis queuing up for the film. At first I thought the
        clerk at the door was asking me for my ticket. I handed
        it to him gleefully and he said, &quot;no, I want to know
        if you are carrying a gun or other weapon.&quot; I
        couldn&#146;t help but wonder why they restricted them
        here? Had someone gotten too enthusiastic once and shot
        up the screen during an action thriller?</font></p>

        <td><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>9 November, Jerusalem
        to En Gedi, 84 km (a)</b></font><p><font size="2" face="Arial">It was still Shabbat in Jerusalem. The place
        was like a ghost town. Before leaving for Tel Aviv, we
        had one important mission to complete, namely the Muslim
        section of our photo safari. We had been turned away at
        the Dome of the Rock the day before, and had only three
        precious photos left. To get to and from the famous
        shrine, we had to run the gauntlet of the Arab souk along
        the Street of the Chain not once but twice. All I could
        think of was that we&#146;d be leaving this bizarre place
        the following day, thank you Jesus, Jehova and Allah.
        Once inside, we learned that the Dome, the nearby mosque
        and the Islam Museum charged a hefty admission, which we
        grudgingly paid in order to see the insides of these
        exquisite buildings. Outside in the enormous courtyard, I
        posed Fred genuflecting towards Mecca and washing his
        feet in a fountain. Mission accomplished, we rushed back
        to our hotel to dump off our camera before heading to Tel
        Aiv.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">--A big mistake, it turns
        out, for what followed was one of the more photogenic
        days we&#146;ve experienced. I ought to have asked Amit
        and Sharon what they had planned for us&#133; </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Since buses don&#146;t run
        on the Sabbath, we had to take a service taxi, squeezed
        in with a bunch of other infidels. Sharon picked us up at
        the bus station, and took us back to his place, pointing
        out the buildings he had worked on as an architect along
        the way. In the car with him was the incomparable Adam,
        whom I haven&#146;t seen since his infancy in Paris. Now
        Adam is a singularly enthusiastic young Israeli who
        learns Arabic at school (&quot;I can learn English from
        the Internet&quot;, proclaimed the ten-year-old). When we
        arrived at their flat in central Tel Aviv, Amit informed
        us that we&#146;d have to stay until the evening, since
        there was going to be a memorial/demonstration for second
        anniversary of Rabin&#146;s assassination. We nodded our
        heads in agreement and voiced dismay over not having
        brought the camera.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Our intellectual Israeli
        friends took us out to a fantastic lunch by the seaside
        in Jaffa. Adam remained energetic throughout, and talked
        freely to everyone we met, seemingly confident in the
        adult world. After lunch, Fred got on Sharon&#146;s
        computer to update our site while Sharon advised me on
        our upcoming trip to Egypt&#146;s Sinai. Amit meanwhile
        informed me that Claire and William of Chalonnes would be
        in Jordan in just a couple of days, which corresponded
        precisely with our plans. Soon thereafter friends arrived
        from Jerusalem with their kids in order to attend the
        demonstration, only a couple of blocks away. From a table
        at a caf downstairs we watched a human river pour into
        Rabin Square. Everyone sitting with us were visibly
        excited, saying how this would be the largest
        demonstration in the history of Israel.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">There certainly were a lot
        of people, many of them carrying anti-Netanyahu placards.
        A huge video screen had been set up so everyone could see
        the speakers. Of course the many speeches were
        unintelligible to us, and after a couple of hours of
        standing among the throngs, we eagerly volunteered to
        babysit back at the flat. Still, I&#146;m glad we were
        able to participate in such an event, and to have viewed
        it from what felt like the core of Israel&#146;s
        intelligentsia. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The next morning featured
        an exhilarating 1500 meter descent to the shores of the
        Dead Sea, though getting out of Jerusalem involved some
        pretty unpleasant climbing. Mt. Zion was definitely not
        designed with biking in mind. Lining the long slope
        downwards were Israeli settlements resembling prisons,
        plus several large Bedouin encampments. Just how this
        latter group manages to eke out an existence remains a
        mystery to me, since there appeared to be nothing for
        their animals to graze on in the barren hills. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Predictably, it was baking
        down in the valley, where my altimeter read -600 meters.
        The over-oxygenated air is supposed to give one bonus
        energy, but you could have fooled me. I thought we&#146;d
        be fried into bikebrats jerky by the sun before reaching
        any civilization, and a pair of truly diabolical hills
        along the shore of the Dead Sea nearly did us in.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Before searching for a
        place to settle for the evening, we had our requisite
        float in the Dead Sea, whose extreme salt and mineral
        content push you towards the surface. We bobbed like
        corks for a while, noticing how soft the water made our
        skin feel. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">As it was already getting
        late, we set about the task of finding beds. The hostel
        up the hill was full except for yucky dorm beds, and the
        &quot;field school&quot; a vertiginous couple of hundred
        meters higher had a gloomy (and overpriced) feel to it,
        so we headed back to the campground at the beach. Fred
        was a little leery at first, but it turned out to be fun.
        For one thing, we met a couple of other cyclists. Dave
        from Holland came by as we were setting up our tent.
        Scruffy-looking with dirty long hair and lacerated skin,
        he was obviously drunk out of his mind, barely able to
        maintain his balance. As we set up our tent he complained
        of his traveling mates, telling us over and over again
        that while he was a &quot;serious cyclist&quot;, they
        were just a bunch of hacks. More interesting was Renon
        (or something like that; we&#146;ll call him Rodent,
        since he kind of looked like one), a little Israeli with
        long dark hair and a brand new deluxe mountain bike, and
        an outfit from outer space. &quot;It cost me 5,000
        dollars&quot; he told us, and explained how he had just
        quit his job in Tel Aviv to travel for as long as he
        could. He, too, had come down from Jerusalem that day,
        but via the wadis, or gulches. He demonstrated for us his
        system, and how he could jump over rocks even while
        carrying a heavy load on his back. Rodent said he was on
        his way to the Rainbow Gathering a hundred kilometers
        south, and that this was merely a preliminary trip before
        departing for India next month. What is it about Israel
        that makes it such an ideal breeding ground for
        eccentrics? We seem to have met more rugged
        individualists here than anyplace else we&#146;ve been.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">There&#146;s not much to
        do at Ein Gedi campground after 5pm, when the sun sets.
        After chatting a bit with other campers (avoiding our
        drunken Dutch friend, who was probably passed out by
        now), we slipped into our seldom-used nylon home and a
        deep, deep sleep.</font></p>

        Valley, reflecting off the oily-looking waters of the
        Dead Sea and rousing me from my slumber. It was deadly
        quiet in the campground when I shuffled off to the
        showers, leaving Andy dreaming of hyraxes and agoutis. I
        was surprised to find Rodent drying himself off with a
        sarong there. I&#146;d expected him to have found some
        very &quot;natural&quot; place to pitch his tent as he
        had told us the night before. In fact he&#146;d met his
        friend the lifeguard of Ein Gedi and crashed in his
        trailer home on the beach that night. He asked to ride
        with us that day and we agreed to meet after breakfast. I
        couldn&#146;t help but wonder what a day with our armored
        friend would be like.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">When Andy arose, we closed
        up camp, went for another swim and headed for breaky.
        Somehow on the way to the miserable camp restaurant he
        got me to admit that I actually like camping. The Dead
        Sea waters must have somehow made me delirious. Whatever
        I liked about camping was soon forgotten when we reached
        the canteen. It was a sad affair filled with
        not-so-refined Eastern European travelers and their
        screaming offspring. On top of it all the cuisine was
        just a bit below my standards (that is saying something
        after nine months on the road&#133;.) While we were
        eating, another cyclist arrived, headed directly for the
        WC and began bathing himself. A few minutes later we were
        exchanging stories with him and poking at our nearly
        inedible breakfast. He&#146;d already ridden three hours
        this morning though it was still before 9 a.m. Ben the
        Brit told us of his honeymoon cycling trip and how it
        might have been a mistake. We procrastinated for a long
        time before leaving, both finding Ben entertaining and
        dreading leaving because we both had the sniffles.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Once on the road the warm
        sun baked us and the wind shoved our tired butts along.
        Places to stop are few and far between in this
        inhospitable desert. We finally came upon a truck stop
        around lunch time and helped ourselves to yet another
        roadside falafel. Though our appearance must have been
        horrific, we served some purpose for our fellow diners.
        Our sweat and dirt caked bodies drew the thousands of
        desert flies to us and away from their food. One of the
        other patrons was a weird and scary looking paramilitary
        dude with a sidearm and fatigues. He strutted around
        nervously in his uniform that bore no markings of the
        Israeli military or police.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Riding another 30
        kilometers or so with the wind at our back we enjoyed the
        ever dramatic desert scenery until the weather began to
        change. Andy was eager to ride onward, but I sensed that
        this would be more than the average shower. We managed to
        make it to another roadside canteen just in time to watch
        the air turn to liquid, the roads to streams and the
        desert to mud. We were advised to wait it out and offered
        a night&#146;s shelter at the local moshav (a close
        cousin to a kibbutz). </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The rain brought others
        seeking shelter. The restaurant filled slowly with moist
        hippies who had been hanging in a wadi celebrating a
        Rainbow Gathering. We shared dates and stories with them
        while waiting for the rain to pass listening to the
        &quot;Hair&quot; soundtrack. Just a few moments into the
        storm the roof of the restaurant gave way and water
        started to steam into the lounge. Employees frantically
        re-purposed trash cans into buckets, moved merchandise
        and squeegeed the floor.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Ehudi, our young host (who
        we knicknamed agouti) and general manager of the place,
        was busily arranging our evening while we sipped coffee.
        He&#146;d found a place for our bikes and arranged for a
        ride to the moshav. On the way to our little apartment
        Agouti explained that a moshav differed from a kibbutz in
        that everyone has their individual businesses and derives
        some of their own revenue from them as well as
        contributing to the benefit of the larger community. It
        is more of a socialist as opposed to a communist
        arrangement. Most of the families also benefit from the
        assistance of Thai workers who are paid 1020 shekels each
        month in addition to room and board.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">There was a little
        confusion that evening when it came time to pay. First,
        we&#146;d thought that the price quoted was for the two
        of us to stay in the room together. It turned out that
        they expected us to pay 85 shekels each. That seemed
        exorbitant. Second, though we&#146;d been told that
        we&#146;d be alone in the room, our host told us that a
        woman and her two children would share the little place.
        We were less enthusiastic about the evening now and took
        corrective measures. We bargained our host down further,
        but still had to deal with our roommates which would
        prove to be a daunting task. She stormed into the
        kitchen, said nary a word to us and made us feel
        generally unwelcome. Until she needed a favor she said
        nothing and did not even introduce herself until I
        interrupted her request to borrow shampoo. Fortunately we
        slept soundly after her children stopped crying and
        dreamed of a sunny day on the road.</font></p>

        life on the <i>moshav</i>, and I&#146;m glad it was only
        for one day. We got up before dawn in order to catch a
        ride with Ehud and his crew back to the highway
        restaurant up the hill. Nobody sharing the van with us
        said much on the way there, and none seemed too enthused
        by the prospect of going to work. I learned that our
        carpool companions, plus just about everyone else in the
        community, worked at least six days a week, from dawn
        until well past sunset. When I noticed some of the same
        Thai workers I&#146;d seen coming back from the fields
        last night I asked Ehud about them and he said every
        family employed &quot;six or seven&quot; imported
        laborers, each earning only 1020 shekels (about $300) a
        month. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Soon we had been reunited
        with our bicycles and were munching on croissants and
        coffee generously provided by Ehud, who told us how he
        had abbreviated his stint in the military by disagreeing
        with his superiors. With dismay we looked out the window
        and noticed the flags flapping outside. During the night
        the wind had shifted 180 degrees. It would be a long 130
        km to Aqaba. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The desert takes on a
        wholly different aspect when riding against a headwind.
        While it had seemed beautiful and magical yesterday, it
        looked harsh and endless today. In my head I kept
        calculating how much further we had to go, and each
        kilometer felt longer than the previous one. After a
        couple of hours of difficult pumping, KM 101appeared like
        a mirage in the distance. A ramshackle compound in the
        middle of the vast desert, this kibbutz-cum-rest
        stop/roadside attraction (complete with live monkeys)
        looked uncannily like the set from &quot;The Road
        Warrior.&quot; Any variance from the desiccated
        wilderness and baking sun take on an oasis appearance,
        though; it was as if we had stumbled upon Shangri-La. We
        scarfed down falafels and ice creams (despite the fact
        that it was still before 10am) and queried an American
        who worked there about the road ahead. I meant to ask him
        what possibly could have led him from Bellingham, WA to
        such a god-forsaken place, but he seemed very occupied
        with an overabundance of chores. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">After another hour or so
        of pedaling, we had reached the day&#146;s summit, at 260
        meters above sea level, and the wind had somehow managed
        to shift to our favor again. The road ahead of us was a
        sight to behold. It descended gradually, sublimely,
        towards the floor of the vast valley of Wadi Araba,
        making for almost unsurpassed cycling ecstasy. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">We stopped for lunch at
        another oasis, this one a considerably more stylish
        kibbutz, complete with manicured lawns, a gleaming
        restaurant, and a swimming pool. We toyed with idea of
        spending the night in this beautiful place, but
        regretfully decided to press on towards Jordan. This brat
        was ready to experience a new country. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Climbing into my saddle, I
        noticed that my front tire had gone flat, the tire
        I&#146;d been riding on since Pensacola, almost eight
        thousand kilometers ago (converting me to a steadfast
        believer in Continental 2000 tires). After putting on a
        new tire supplied by brother Mar-tay and trashing the old
        one with a twinge of nostalgia, we were back on the road,
        screaming southwards with the most delicious tailwind I
        can recall since our ride out of El Paso. I thought how
        we&#146;d be following this tack all the way down the
        Sinai coast and smiled. Forty-some k. later we turned a
        bend and saw the Gulf of Aqaba. In my head I could hear
        Peter O&#146; Toole as T. E. Lawrence pronounce the
        ancient port&#146;s name as if it was the Promised Land,
        and I couldn&#146;t help feeling the same. It glistened
        in the distance, a gathering of white buildings
        stretching along an aquamarine sea, in stark contrast to
        the Vegas-esque megahotels of Eilat, on the Israeli side
        of the border. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Alas, Aqaba was to remain
        just out of our grasp for the time being. When we arrived
        at the border, the Israeli police warned us that Jordan
        wouldn&#146;t let us in with bikes. Feeling invincible
        after such an invigorating ride, we decided we&#146;d try
        our luck, gambling the hefty exit tax levied by the
        Jewish State. &#150;A losing bet, it turns out. While the
        Jordanian immigrations officer at the other side of the
        no-man&#146;s land was sympathetic to our cause, nothing
        we could say or do seemed to help. He called his
        supervisor a couple of times, to no avail. Our bikes
        could only come in if they were in a box or in a truck,
        and he had no place to stash them at the border either.
        &quot;Try the other side,&quot; he suggested (meaning
        Israel), &quot;they&#146;ll be able to keep your
        bikes.&quot; </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Fat chance. The Israelis
        welcomed us back by subjecting us to a thorough search
        through all of our belongings, even though they knew full
        well that we hadn&#146;t even made it into Jordan. No one
        was around to give us and our bikes a lift, and leaving
        our bikes anywhere near the border proved
        &quot;impossible.&quot; So it was back up a rude little
        hill (and straight into the wind which had blown us down
        here). </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">We still had a good hour
        and a half of daylight. Still eager to make it to a new
        country, I proposed to Fred that we bike into Egypt, just
        ten kilometers away. He convinced me that this was
        madness, thinking it wiser to search out a place to ditch
        our bikes for a week while we tour Jordan by motorized
        transport. I gave in to this idea, and
        &#150;unbelievably&#151;we found a place to stash the
        bikes almost immediately, in the bomb shelter of a nearby
        kibbutz. Tired, dirty and frustrated, I walked into the
        kibbutz office and asked if we could leave our bikes
        there, expecting to be rejected. But friendly Alexandro
        from Argentina surprised us. &quot;Sure,&quot; he said,
        &quot;here&#146;s the key.&quot; </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">We stripped our bikes of
        what we thought would be essential in Jordan, and headed
        back to the border, on foot this time. &quot;Welcome to
        Jordan,&quot; said the many employees at the border,
        leading us through a bewildering maze of Arab
        bureaucracy. Before being released, we had to submit to a
        customs inspection (where they confiscated all our food),
        change money, buy visas, declare our computer, and show
        our passports to seemingly dozens of guys in uniform
        whose exact jobs remained unclear. After the dead-serious
        efficiency of Israeli immigration, the Jordanian approach
        to immigration (and life in general, it turns out) had a
        haphazard, low-tech feel to it. We had definitely entered
        another world.</font></p>
