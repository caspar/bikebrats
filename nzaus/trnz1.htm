        <td><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>20 February, uphill
        from Taupo to the Whakapapa, 99km (f)</b></font><p><font size="2" face="Arial">A gray day greeted us through the
        massive sliding glass doors of our room. Lake
        Taupo&#146;s reflection of the dismal sky left it looking
        like a great disk of diamond-plate steel. My mood was in
        tune with the weather. I couldn&#146;t help but think our
        luck had run out on us after the event of the day before.
        My perceptions seemed to come true as we rode through the
        drizzle along the lake and cars whooshed by us.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Fortunately the cloudy sky
        began to dissolve, sun cracking through the breaking
        clouds. Just as we began to be bathed in the sunlight we
        came across a rather large sow which we goaded into
        posing for our camera with a granola bar. What I&#146;d
        anticipated as a calm and easy morning became a little
        more challenging as we ascended to the tops of the cliffs
        surrounding Lake Taupo climbing some 200 meters in two
        kilometers or so. Riding along the top we were afforded
        views of the massive lake formed by a collapsed volcano
        millions of years before.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">In the exhilaration of our
        descent I began to forget the way the day began as we
        reached terminal velocity down the other side.
        Circumstance soon reminded me of my earlier sentiments
        when a pack of soccer fans started driving by us. They
        all had the &quot;stars and bars&quot; of the confederate
        flag draped in their rear windows and jeered at us as
        they passed. I nearly leapt off my bike when one used an
        amplified megaphone as they passed me. I felt a solid hit
        to my kidneys as one zoomed by. Couldn&#146;t figure what
        had hit me, but it felt like a softball with its speed.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Until that point I
        hadn&#146;t thought of Andy who was trailing behind me by
        a few hundred yards. I became worried about what
        indignities and assaults he had suffered at their hands
        and stopped to find out. He&#146;d been hit by something
        too; it had left a welt on his back and exploded on
        impact. We stopped at a little market and a deliveryman
        made a call to the police on our behalf.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The route from there was
        stupendously lovely and narrow road that wound along the
        rocky lip of the lake. It was hard to concentrate on the
        beauty of the ride with huge double trailer lorries
        passing so closely to us along with the fresh memory of
        our recent attack as distractions. I found myself
        flinching as each vehicle passed. Stopping at a
        campground for a snack we exchanged stories with the
        owner, who told us she&#146;d run the young rebel
        hooligans off her parking lot a few moments before. She
        called ahead to the police and added to our complaint.
        The police told her that they&#146;d stopped the car and
        hoped we&#146;d stop in at the police station at the next
        town to make a report. I found some elation in the fact
        that they&#146;d been at least stopped. Perhaps scared
        about the consequences of their actions. Even so another
        vehicle with the flag passed, this time throwing water
        balloons at us, renewing my flinching reflex.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Our experience at the
        police station left me in no way assured that there would
        be any consequence to our report. The desk officer gave
        me no confidence that there would be any follow-up.
        Surely no one would ever be able to comprehend the report
        he wrote before us; every other word contained a grave
        misspelling. Afterwards we downed a fast food lunch and
        were on our way. Our route following lunch could take us
        two different ways. One via a quiet road up six
        kilometers sharply to over one thousand meters. The other
        over a busy road though more gradual. I lobbied for the
        quiet one; we could simply &quot;take our medicine&quot;
        and do the climbing more quickly. I am not sure if this
        was the smarter decision, for the climb reduced my legs
        to wobbly rubbery appendages and we still had some 45
        kilometers to make our final destination.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Our guidebook described
        the terrain as flat for the next hours and a pair of
        older cyclotourists affirmed that when we met at a café
        while snacking. The owner of the roadside tearoom was a
        motorcycle and cat enthusiast. The walls of his little
        shop were covered by posters of BMW two-wheelers while
        the furniture and floor seemed covered by his cats. In
        reality there were only two, an Abyssinian and a Persian.
        They were absolute whores for attention.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The reality of our
        afternoon was that it was a constant uphill and we
        ascended yet another 600 meters that evening before
        reaching our destination. Our residence that evening was
        to be the Grand Chateau Hotel in Whakapapa village. We
        recognized it on the side of the massive volcano from the
        postcards we&#146;d seen of the volcano erupting behind
        the building. It loomed ahead and above us for miles.
        When we drove up the driveway and entered the lobby, our
        receptionist asked us if it was raining out, so drenched
        we were with sweat. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The name Whakapapa
        presented some problems in and of itself. First, in the
        Maori language the sound &quot;wh&quot; is pronounced as
        an aspirate &quot;f&quot;. Second, an &quot;a&quot;
        following this consonant is pronounce &quot;uh&quot;.
        Making the name of the town sound obscene if you dared to
        pronounce it correctly. We were in a &quot;no-win&quot;
        situation, if we dared pronounce it correctly the locals
        blushed and looked as us as though we were being
        presumptuous. Pronouncing the name as we would in English
        yielded a quick correction. More often I allow myself the
        luxury of pronouncing everything wrong and giving the
        Kiwis the pleasure of correcting me.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The hotel itself was
        Andy&#146;s favorite type. Sporting a faded grandeur and
        vacant feel that evoked the same spine chilling effect
        you&#146;d get from watching &quot;The Shining&quot; late
        at night in an empty house. Before dining in the massive
        formal dining room we played a game of pool on a table so
        large I felt like Alice in Wonderland. It had special
        long cues and bridges in order to use it. Without
        exaggeration, it was at least 3 meters by six meters,
        perhaps larger, and the balls were less than regulation
        size --making our game all the more challenging.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">At dinner I nearly fell
        asleep at the table. My belly was full and my legs were
        aching. It had been many months since I&#146;d ascended
        over 1300 meters and ridden over 100 kilometers in a day.</font></p>

        to Ohakune, 54km (a) </b></font><p><font size="2" face="Arial">We woke up to find ourselves ensconced in a
        thick misty cloud &#150;which did not bode well for the
        day of hiking we had planned. We decided to postpone any
        decision as to what we&#146;d do with our day until after
        breakfast, however. Downstairs in the dining room, the
        same tape we had heard last night was playing
        &#150;classical music&#146;s greatest hits-- and this
        influenced our decision to ride. Charming as the
        once-elegant Grand Chateau hotel was, did we really want
        to be trapped up here another night, inside of a cloud,
        listening to Pavarotti sing &quot;Nessun Dorma&quot;? </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Within what seemed like
        minutes, we were flying down the long hill towards a
        crossroads called National Park. Rather than abating in
        lower altitude, the mist grew worse here, occasionally
        thickening into something classifiable as genuine rain.
        It was a nice change of pace to be whooshing downhill,
        though, so I didn&#146;t mind a bit. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Climbing out of a deeply
        cut gorge, we caught up with a pair of our cyclist
        brethren, Cathy and Gordon from northern England. We
        stopped to talk to the older couple by the roadside under
        the intermittent drizzle, and were struck by their
        gumption. Pressing on to our goal &#150;where we knew we
        could catch a train to Wellington in time for Saturday
        night&#151;we raced down a long, almost imperceptible
        descent, with what must have been a pretty strong
        tailwind. After half an hour of this pedaling bliss, we
        turned off to the left into gorgeous sheep-filled scenery
        at the foot of the North Island&#146;s tallest mountain
        (shrouded in clouds). </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Ohakune surprised us by
        being easily the most charming country town we&#146;d
        passed through in this country. It had a frontier,
        old-West look and feel to it. We stopped at Visitor
        Information to get the dope on the train and learned that
        Okahune&#146;s landmark, a giant plaster carrot, lay just
        down the road. I insisted we bike there for a photo
        before lunch in a trendy café, where we ate bagels and
        ran into Gordon and Cathy once again. They were done
        cycling for the day, and we envied them staying in such a
        beautiful place. Fred proposed several times that we do
        the same, but since the train didn&#146;t run the next
        day (NZ basically shuts down on Sundays), we thought it
        best to stick with plan A &#150;or was it plan B? </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The train station was a
        ways out of town and absolutely deserted. We were the
        only passengers to get on or off when the dinky rattling
        old iron horse hissed to a stop. An officious woman told
        us we&#146;d have to take our bags off our bikes before
        loading them, then recanted when we said we&#146;d lift
        them up ourselves. The same woman sold us our tickets,
        served us tea and provided a running commentary
        throughout the bumpy 5-hour journey. For all we knew she
        was driving the train, too. </font></p>

        Every bone in my body had ached, so I felt no shame in
        arriving to Wellington by train. We did feel some shame
        and panic when we realized that every accommodation in
        the entire town was booked. Except for the kindness of a
        woman at the train station we&#146;d have never found a
        place to stay. As it was we ended up out by the airport
        the first day.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">We managed a place in the
        center of Wellington the next day. There we developed a
        feel for the city, which is decidedly quirky. It felt as
        though a weird little city like Santa Cruz, California,
        with all of its hippies and odd-balls, had been declared
        a capital. Complicating matters, the International Dragon
        Boat Competition was being held along side the National
        Maori Cultural Festival.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The amazing tourist
        attraction of Wellington is their new national showcase
        museum, Te Papa. It is truly the &quot;papa&quot; of all
        museums. Its edifice is like an airport terminal in
        stature, floating out by the harbor, its massive halls
        filled with geologic, historic, cultural, natural and
        technologic exhibits. Perhaps one of the more amazing
        museums I&#146;ve ever seen. Like the town of Wellington,
        many of the exhibits were quirky and strangely curated.
        My favorite was the sheep and wool exhibit that explored
        the history and uses of sheep in New Zealand.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">One of the best bargains
        of the trip, after the free trip to Te Papa was the
        repair of my damaged bag. When the Dutchman and I
        collided it tore the buckle off one of my front panniers.
        It cost only $3.50 for the buckle and sewing it on.</font></p>

        Wellington/Picton to Hauwai, 65km (a)</b></font><p><font size="2" face="Arial">I don&#146;t think I knew what wind
        was until today. From the moment I woke up and peered out
        the filthy, rain-spattered window of my little cell, I
        knew it wouldn&#146;t be an optimal riding day. But the
        rain was only a secondary problem, or so I realized
        during the ride to the boat harbor, which was way too
        fast and way too easy &#150;meaning that the wind was
        coming out of the south, the direction we&#146;d be
        heading the rest of the day.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The scenery between
        Wellington and Picton is said to be gorgeous. We
        didn&#146;t see any of it, though. Fog and rain had
        swallowed up all the views, and it was way too cold to go
        out on deck. So we spent the three-hour voyage gabbing
        with an adventurous German cyclist called Stefan and an
        angelically beautiful young Dane called Finn. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">It was raining pretty hard
        when we disembarked in Picton, but we decided to do the
        butch thing and ride. It was tough going at first, up a
        big hill that led out of town, against the wind and under
        the rain. But after a while the rain subsided and the
        road led through a steep-sided canyon that cut off most
        of the wind. When we arrived in the town of Blenheim
        &#150;where we thought we&#146;d spend the night&#151;the
        sun was shining, tempting us to continue, wind or not. At
        tourist information, we booked
        bed-and-breakfast-and-dinner on a farm some forty
        kilometers further down the road. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">We figured we&#146;d make
        it there in two hours, three hours tops, but it took
        closer to four. The wind had picked up considerably and
        was coming right at us. All our concentration was focused
        on simply keeping our bikes on the road, and proceeding
        towards our goal, one revolution of the pedals at a time.
        Pretty as the scenery was &#150;especially through two
        rather high passes&#151;the riding was hell. The wind was
        so loud I literally couldn&#146;t hear myself think. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Just as I was
        contemplating crawling into a ditch and quietly dying, a
        car pulled up to us and stopped. The pumpkin-shaped
        driver leapt out and asked if we were two tired Yanks. It
        was Pete, our host for the night, and he was offering us
        a ride the final couple of km back to his place. On the
        way, he pointed out NZ&#146;s only salt works and the
        site of the new port, which he saw as his winning lottery
        ticket. He told us that when the Wellington boat arrives
        literally at his front door, he&#146;ll have a housefull
        of guests every night. In spite of his optimism, Fred and
        I noticed no work underway to make this new port a
        reality. Pete may very well have a long wait ahead of
        him. And in the meantime, he&#146;ll be working in the
        salt mine in order to make ends meet. Tomorrow is the
        first day in thirty-five years that he&#146;ll be working
        for someone else. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Pete&#146;s house is
        pleasantly situated in a little glade at the base of some
        hills and was therefore protected from the screaming
        gale. He introduced us to his &quot;housekeeper&quot;
        Joy. &quot;I give her free room and board in exchange for
        housework,&quot; he explained with some embarrassment,
        causing us to wonder if he wasn&#146;t telling the whole
        story. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;We&#146;re having
        seafood soup and steaks for tea,&quot; announced Pete.
        Did this mean we&#146;d be having scones and crumpets for
        dinner? When I announced my intention to go out and have
        a look at his sheep (15/16<sup> </sup>purebred Fresians,
        which he keeps for stud purposes), Pete made a rather
        off-color joke involving gumboots. And during the
        newscast we all watched together, chomping away at the
        delicious meal, our opinionated host maintained a running
        commentary. Overall, a hilarious evening. And one which
        came to an abrupt end. Country people turn in early, it
        appears, which suits us fine in our wind-blown state. </font></p>

        the rattling was too intense. Luckily I was sleeping in
        the part of the farmhouse that rested on a cement slab,
        unlike Andy and the others, who rode the quake atop the
        pilings that made the foundation in the back part of the
        house. Andy darted about the house excitedly, admitting
        that it was his first major earthquake. It measured 5.8
        on the Richter scale; even so we all somehow made it back
        to sleep, except for Pete. Today would be his first day
        working at the salt marsh down the road. Before the quake
        he had some trepidation about starting the new job;

        have to fight the vicious winds of the day before again.
        Thankfully as we set off down Pete and Joy&#146;s gravel
        driveway the sky was clear and the breeze non-existent.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The first part of the day
        reminded me of the coastal hills of California. Brown
        drought-dry grass covered the rolling hills where sheep
        grazed instead of cows amongst the occasional trees. Soon
        we rolled down to the coast where the road hugged the
        craggy coast. Denser greener foliage carpeted the
        volcano-formed slopes of the snow-capped mountains above
        us. We stopped to talk to a pair of German cyclists who
        where decidedly antisocial and went on our way. Stopping
        only to photograph sea lions nursing their pups and
        basking in the warm sun on the rocks, we pedaled on to
        Kaikoura.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Our motel in Kaikoura, the
        aptly named Panorama, gave us a startlingly beautiful
        view of the bay and the mountains beyond. Pushing up the
        sea bottom&#146;s limestone formations formed the coastal
        lands. Squiggly white layers of rock make fantastically
        intricate seascapes, where we found birds nesting and
        seals resting during our evening walk. Hiking up the
        cliff, we walked amongst sheep grazing in the golden
        sunset and I thought that a sheep&#146;s life might not
        be so bad here. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">On our way back to the
        Panorama we stumbled upon a little café that served us a
        world class meal. There we met Belgium and Iranian
        couples, shared a bottle of wine and reveled in what a
        perfect day this had been. What a contrast to the day
        before!</font></p>

        <td><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>26 February, Kaikoura
        to Cheviot, 76km (a)</b></font><p><font size="2" face="Arial">The frantic pace of the NZ segment of our
        tour caught up with me this morning. Motivating myself to
        get out of bed was harder than usual, even with two cups
        of coffee (thoughtfully provided by my considerate riding
        partner) under my belt. Just as we were discussing our
        breakfast options, our Arizonan-Iranian neighbor, Mike,
        came by and asked us if we wanted some cereal, thus
        saving us a stop and getting us on the road at the bright
        and early hour of 10:30. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The first 20-odd
        kilometers of the day took us along more beautiful
        coastline, with more seals and huge colonies of sea
        birds. Then the road turned abruptly inland and up into a
        serious of steep but beautiful passes. We panted and
        strained our way up a slope, only to drop down again and
        recommence climbing. On the plus side, the scenery here
        was stunning. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Once we&#146;d descended
        again, the ride became much easier, following river
        valleys past endless fields of sheep. Some of these
        beasts looked different from what we&#146;ve grown
        accustomed to seeing. Having been freshly shorn, they had
        a pinkish hue, resembling baby mice. Passing one barn, I
        heard a telltale buzzing sound, and instructed Fred to
        stop. We thought we could sneak inside and get a photo or
        two of the sheep-shearing, but the gate to the farm was
        firmly closed. The stop wasn&#146;t a total washout,
        however. As we sat waiting for shaved sheep (some of them
        with hockey-style haircuts resembling their
        shearers&#146;) to emerge from a hole in the barn and
        into a holding pen, Masa rode by. We&#146;d met him on
        the boat from Wellington, a cute young Japanese from Kobe
        with an extremely limited vocabulary in English but a
        million-dollar smile. We invited him to ride with us the
        last hilly 10km to Cheviot, where we had a beer in the
        first bar we came across. The place was packed with
        oldsters, many of whom came up to talk to us. One woman
        with a heavy Scottish brogue said she&#146;d seen us from
        the bus earlier and was afraid we&#146;d get
        &quot;burrrnt.&quot; I made her repeat this last word
        four times before I understood her, and assured her that
        we were well-coated in sunscreen. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">We went in search of a
        motel (for us) and campsite (for Masa) and were very
        fortunate to find them both in one complex, an adorable,
        out-of-the-way place run by a friendly Dutch couple. As
        Masa set up his tent, we took a dip in the frigid,
        scum-surfaced pool. On our way out to buy groceries, we
        saw another cyclist checking in and recognized him as
        Earl, a 71-year old from Nebraska who had also been on
        our boat from Wellington. We decided to invite them both
        to dinner at our place and bought the makings for a feast
        in tiny Cheviot&#146;s only grocery store. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Before dinner we still had
        time for a yoga session in a secluded lawn next to a
        field full of wooly baah-ing sheep. It felt fantastic to
        give our sore muscles a proper stretching.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">It was amusing to host a
        dinner party in the middle of nowhere to a couple of
        cycling strangers. Loquacious Earl told us how he&#146;d
        flown to NZ for free aboard an Army plane, and how this
        was his first trip abroad. Everyone back home in his
        small Nebraska town thought he was nuts, but he had been
        determined to cycle New Zealand for a long time. We
        swapped road stories and found his complaints (sadistic
        truck drivers) to match ours exactly. Meantime, Masa
        smiled and shoveled alarming quantities of pasta into his
        face. Both our guests said they were going to get an
        early start the next morning. Fred looked at me hopefully
        and I shook my head. No way was I going to be part of a
        120-km race to Christchurch, where Masa had a rendezvous
        with his girlfriend at three o&#146;clock. &quot;Maybe
        we&#146;ll see you on the road,&quot; I said to Earl and
        Masa as they retreated to their respective tents.</font></p>

        <td><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>27 February, Cheviot
        to Christchurch, 70 km (f)</b></font><p><font size="2" face="Arial">Both Earl and Masa were well along their way
        by the time we finally rolled out of the Cheviot Motel at
        9:30 a.m. The first kilometers of gently rolling brown
        and grassy hills passed by easily though we were
        ascending to make a pass into the Hurunui Valley. We made
        our way up the valley cursing the inaccuracy of our guide
        book which declared the route without noticeable hills
        until the pass into the Greta Valley. Time after time we
        dipped into the river valley and pedaled our way out.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Finally we reached to top
        of the valley and stopped at a gas station for a quick
        roadside meal of chips and drinks, our bodies begging for
        the replenishment of salts. Descending was not the picnic
        we&#146;d anticipated. The wind had taken a turn and we
        were now having to pump our way down the hill and were
        only traveling at 15km/h. With each turn of the crank the
        temperature rose, the road became more truck trafficked
        and we fatigued. As we hit kilometer 70 we arrived in
        Amberly, where we ran into Earl, who had just arrived
        though he&#146;d left two hours before us.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">I&#146;d grown tired of
        trucks passing too closely to us as they passed and
        lobbied Andrew for taking a bus the last kilometers to
        Wellington. He readily agreed and we found a helpful
        woman at the tourist information office to give us advice
        on getting there. While helping us she renewed
        drivers&#146; licenses, answered phones and did her
        nails. She was a tornado in action. &quot;Just make your
        way to the &#145;Tank and Tummy&#146; across the way and
        you can pick up a bus there,&quot; hustling us out the
        door so she could get onto solving the Gulf Crisis for
        Kofi Annan. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">From the faithful T &amp;
        T we had a snack while waiting for our bus. It buzzed by
        us though we were waving frantically and we were ready to
        ride on to Wellington on our own. At the last minute the
        driver hit the brakes, stopped and put our bikes in the
        massive luggage compartment at the back, bags and all.
        Within minutes I was napping and we were on our way to
        the end of the line for us in New Zealand.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">We found our way to the
        YMCA and ran into Masa and Kiko there. Masa was searching
        for a campground in Wellington without any success. The
        town itself was not very cosmopolitan. A hot night there
        involves driving around the block revving your motor and
        trying to run down pedestrians while hooting and
        hollering at chicks. We opted to see the cinematic
        classic &quot;Starship Troopers&quot; and went out for a
        drink.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">At the bar we met the most
        annoying homo ever. Tony greeted us with the standard,
        &quot;Where&#146;ya from?&quot; His follow-up of,
        &quot;I&#146;m so sorry,&quot; failed to warm us to his
        charms. Somehow he&#146;d thought he&#146;d endeared
        himself to us and began talking our ears off until we
        could stand it no longer and left. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">We managed to avoid the
        star attraction of town, climbing up the church tower. It
        was maybe 30 meters high and all we could imagine seeing
        from up there is a view of all the ugly 50&#146;s,
        60&#146;s and 70&#146;s architecture that had polluted
        the Christchurch building stock. We could hardly see the
        advantage of hiking up it especially knowing that
        earthquakes had toppled the tower at least twice since
        its original construction. Of interest is the City Museum
        and Gardens. The museum sports a fantastic exhibit on
        Antarctic exploration as well as more stuffed fauna then
        you can shake a stick at, displayed in really well done
        dioramas.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Departure from
        Christchurch (or ch-ch as the locals abbreviate it) was
        more difficult than anticipated. No bike boxes were
        available at the airport so the logistical nightmare of
        getting the boxed bikes to the airport lay before us. A
        crammed-to-the-gills airport shuttle got us there after
        stopping at every hotel in town before taking us to the
        bike shop to pick up the bikes. We endured the sneers of
        the other passengers while we dealt with the marginally
        competent staff at the shop.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">I had the excited feeling
        we were going on to a new adventure when we finally got
        into the air. Thankfully we&#146;d be arriving the day
        after the madness that is Sydney&#146;s signature gay
        event of the year, The Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras. </font></p>
