        <td><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>26 June, Pakxan/Nam
        Thone to Tha Khek, 101km (f)</b><p>Sometime even before
        the sky turned from black to gray I awoke to the sound of
        the wind hissing through the screen, the windows bouncing
        against their frames and the rain pounding the metal roof
        of our little guest house. A short while later the alarm
        clock interrupted my half-sleep and I opened my eyes to
        find the sky only marginally lighter and the rain falling
        more heavily. We mutually agreed that this might not be
        the best time to depart and decided to take advantage of
        the rain and make a later start. Before settling in for a
        few hours of sleep I shuffled off to the bathroom only to
        find the studly laborer of the day before staring out the
        window looking at the severe storm and dreading his day
        digging in the rain. &quot;It looks like a
        hurricane,&quot; I said to him, even though I doubted his
        command of English.</p>
        <p>He wanted to show me something out the front of the
        guesthouse and beckoned me to follow. The rain had
        reduced washed away most of the dirt they&#146;d shoveled
        the day before and torrents of brown water the color of
        the Mekong were washing along the road. He closed the
        huge sliding steel doors of the hotel and I began to walk
        back towards our room when he stopped me and tentatively
        pet my back and said, &quot;you are lovely.&quot; Still
        half asleep and not feeling especially lovely nor
        articulate I patted him on the back and said something
        ridiculous like &quot;you are cute as well,&quot; before
        politely excusing myself and tumbling back into bed. </p>
        <p>A few hours later we were packing our bags, watching
        the rain and wondering how we&#146;d manage riding in it.
        One option we considered was finding a bus and another
        was to stay another day in the little guesthouse. Just
        after we asked the owner of the hotel about a bus she was
        pounding on door telling us the bus was there and
        we&#146;d better hurry. In the rain we loaded our bikes
        onto the VIP bus and waved goodbye to the family. The
        laborer was waving frenetically and I nearly forgot that
        he was standing with his family when composing my
        goodbye. There was little time to consider anything
        including a goodbye because before I knew it we were on
        the bus and headed down the road.</p>
        <p>As we bumped along the vacant highway the bus&#146;
        air conditioning pumped frigid air onto us. I shivered as
        the once warm rainwater dried in the cool breeze. Huge
        drops of condensation formed on the air ducts above us
        and dropped onto us each time we hit a bump. I moved to
        the front of the bus, where the air conditioner did not
        function, and watched the driver navigate through my
        half-opened eyes. Slipping in and out of sleep I observed
        the now rolling hills and forest lumber by. </p>
        <p>Our driver was in no particular hurry; thankfully that
        was the temperament of most of the drivers for there were
        many obstacles on the road. The surface of the road
        itself was dreamy. Constructed recently by the Swedes it
        sported silky-smooth bitumen with a wide shoulder and
        enormous drainage ditches on either side to whisk away
        the water. Other competition for the road came in the
        form of pigs, cows, water buffalo, tractors, children and
        dogs, all wandering on the two lanes as though traffic
        never passed --and little did. Despite his care our
        driver was unable to miss an unfortunate pig that bolted
        in front of the bus and met its end with a disconcerting
        thump as it rolled under the wheels of the bus.
        &quot;They&#146;ll be having <i>larb</i> (a Laotian pork
        salad) for dinner in that village,&quot; I thought to
        myself, cringing at the image of the blood-splattered
        highway.</p>
        <p>The clouds remained but the rain stopped as we arrived
        at a crossroads. There the bus stopped to take on new
        passengers while the driver inspected the bus for
        pig-damage. Though we&#146;d paid to take the bus to Tha
        Khek we disembarked with our bikes and bags and began to
        load them to complete the ride in true BikeBrats fashion,
        on our bikes. The driver and crew (there were two other
        bus personnel on board, a luggage handler and ticket
        taker, though there were only twenty seats on the bus)
        looked dismayed and a little confused by our departure.
        They and the other passengers waved to us as they passed
        seemingly wondering how we could be so wasteful of our
        money.</p>
        <p>Though there was only intermittent sun it felt hot.
        The rainwater-soaked ground gave up its moisture into the
        air. I swooned in the sauna-like weather conditions. If
        I&#146;d thought yesterday&#146;s ride was peaceful, what
        was this one? There were far fewer cars and villages and
        jungle seemed to encroach on the road. When we did pass
        through a village curious eyes followed our path down the
        road from inside rattan shacks and the voices of young
        children rang out chirping <i>sabai dii</i>. It was a
        classic 3H day (hills, heat, humidity) that left my brain
        dull and my legs achy. After yesterday&#146;s 150km+ day
        I was feeling a little beat. Andy was as well, perhaps
        more than me, for he wanted to have a day of rest in Tha
        Khek the next day.</p>
        <p>When we arrived at our hotel I wasn&#146;t really very
        impressed. It was a massive four-story affair constructed
        of cement facing the Mekong. The architect seemed to have
        forgotten that the river might be picturesque and avoided
        putting windows facing the Mekong so one might look out
        upon its brown waters and across to Thailand. The
        cave-like confines of our room hardly seemed appropriate
        for a day of relaxation and writing. The only window was
        a little hole looking out on the backyard where a
        neighbor burned trash incessantly. The bathroom was
        another horror story. Most of the little inch-square
        floor tiles were loose or completely dislodged and toilet
        seat sported some sort of deposit of unknown origin and
        composition resembling something extracted from the La
        Brea tar pits. Another amenity, the water heater, though
        a prominent feature of the bathroom, did not function.
        When I called this to the attention of the
        not-so-friendly desk staff they said, &quot;the owner has
        no money, so no work.&quot; </p>
        <p>Adding to the ambiance of the hotel were the other
        guests we met at the restaurant. An antipodean couple, a
        girl from New Zealand and a guy from Australia. They were
        eating as I arrived and Andy checked us into our room. I
        greeted them cheerfully as I arrived, &quot;hi!&quot; No
        response was forthcoming. A little later they volunteered
        that they had no idea why they were here in Tha Khek and
        it seemed that they were having a miserable time on what
        might have been a vacation. They left the restaurant
        shortly after we arrived, thankfully, but not before
        creating a horrible scene. The staff had forgotten to
        raise the prices on the English language menu and tried
        to charge them the new prices for food. They were
        demanding 3000 kip from the couple instead of 2500 as
        indicated on the menu, a difference of around fifteen
        cents. Rather than pay the whole amount they shouted at
        the waiter threw their money to him and stormed out of
        the place, grumbling about having been charged the
        &quot;white-faced&quot; price. Good fortune smiled upon
        us, we weren&#146;t to meet them again during our stay in
        Tha Khek.</p>
        <p>If we were to stay an extra day in Tha Khek I was
        resolute in the idea that it be in a different place.
        Down the street was another hotel housed in an old police
        station. We stopped by and found that it was a full
        service hotel offering comfort girls who displayed
        themselves prominently around the lobby. At dinner in a
        restaurant that resembled a refrigerator both in its
        gleaming whiteness and temperature I convinced Andy that
        we should try to ride the next day rather than soak up
        the ambience in Tha Khek. In the morning we&#146;d look
        at the weather, see how we felt and perhaps go on to
        Savannahkhet to meet Ly, Caroline and her family.</font></p>

        <p>Savannahkhet's answer to Paris' Eiffel Tower, the
        giant soyabean</p>
        </td>
        <td><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>27 June, Tha Khek to
        Savannakhet, 139km (a)</b><p>The sweet sweet music of
        pounding rain greeted my ears this morning. I could sleep
        in, have a day off the bike. My last dream of the morning
        concerned Fred&#146;s dissatisfaction with our lodgings;
        in my reverie I convinced him that it wasn&#146;t such a
        bad place to stay after all, and it was only one more
        night... Suddenly, I was being shaken awake. &quot;I
        think it&#146;s letting up. Do you want to ride?&quot;
        --came the unwelcome voice of my overanxious riding
        partner. What I thought was an unambiguous &quot;NO&quot;
        didn&#146;t convince him however, and soon he&#146;d
        coaxed me out of bed and through the rain to a sleazy
        little breakfast joint/grocery store on Tha Khek&#146;s
        dilapidated fountain square, built by the French some
        eighty years ago, and mostly neglected ever since. </p>
        <p>Two falangs and their Lao colleagues were seated at a
        table next to us. They turned out to be Americans,
        working for an NGO out of Vietnam, something to do with
        bio-diversity. Some sort of conference was going on all
        weekend, explaining the buildup of sports utility
        vehicles in our hotel&#146;s parking lot. One of the
        Americans had met Kim, the Danish cyclist, in Northern
        Laos, thus confirming our suspicions that Laos can get
        very small very fast. </p>
        <p>While I munched on my baguette stuffed with fried eggs
        (&quot;Lao McMuffin&quot;) Fred continued to work me,
        trying to persuade me to ride. </p>
        <p>&quot;It&#146;s still raining, Fred,&quot; I said.<br>
        &quot;Yeah, but I think it&#146;s letting up.&quot;<br>
        &quot;Why are you so keen on getting to Savannakhet
        anyway?&quot;<br>
        &quot;I don&#146;t like it here.&quot;<br>
        &quot;Well, I&#146;ve got news for you. Savannakhet
        probably looks a lot like this.&quot; I made a sweeping
        gesture towards the trash-strewn plaza. I hated to
        disappoint him, but for some reason Fred has developed an
        &quot;end of the rainbow&quot; kind of mentality, in
        which the next, as yet unseen, destination is always more
        appealing than the present one. Was he expecting
        Savannakhet to look like Zurich?</p>
        <p>Despite my whining, Fred did manage to get me onto my
        bike and pedal out of town under bleakly drizzling skies.
        Within five minutes we were covered in mud, picking our
        way out of town down a road resembling a minefield.
        Things improved a little when we got back to Highway 13,
        but my energy was severely wanting. The kilometers seemed
        to be clicking off especially slowly today, dampened by
        the drizzle and a persistent headwind. Would I be able to
        make it the 140 kilometers to Savannakhet, or would we
        have to flag down a bus at some point? I hated feeling so
        weak&#133;</p>
        <p>The route became fairly hilly and the jungle closed
        in. The only villages we saw were extremely primitive,
        just haphazard collections of tumbledown huts. No place
        seemed to have electricity. At a seven-eleven stop, we
        watched the shopkeeper dig a deeper hole for his precious
        chunk of ice. He seemed perplexed when we turned down his
        offer of a gritty chunk of the stuff. And then there were
        the kids, the filthiest little creatures we&#146;ve seen
        anywhere, usually naked from the waist down, their bodies
        and t-shirts positively encrusted. Instead of the
        friendly &quot;<i>sabai-di&#146;s</i>&quot; we&#146;ve
        grown accustomed to hearing, here we were greeted with
        the less welcoming &quot;falang.&quot; We promised
        ourselves we&#146;d learn the Lao term for
        &quot;peasant&quot; as a rejoinder. </p>
        <p>Ponies started to appear, the first we&#146;d seen in
        Laos. Some grazed by the roadside while others pulled
        cartloads of people or goods. All of them, like their
        bovine and human counterparts, were painfully scrawny. </p>
        <p>A huge commotion was going on in one village we passed
        through. A pig being slaughtered was apparently far more
        interesting to the local kids than two falang cyclists. I
        stopped to take a picture, and when I came back across
        the road Fred was amiably chatting with someone in a
        white pickup truck. It was Ly&#146;s brother, Sak, on his
        way to Vientiane with a part for a friend&#146;s car. He
        told us it was another hundred kilometers to Savannakhet,
        and that the road was anything but flat. &quot;You guys
        sure are brave to do this on bikes,&quot; he commented
        with a disbelieving shake of his head before speeding
        off. </p>
        <p>After another hour or so of demoralizing riding, we
        reached a crest and realized how much we had climbed. In
        front of us the road dropped into a broad valley, and
        from here on in the riding was much better. Our morale
        and energy returned, and Savannakhet no longer seemed an
        unattainable goal. </p>
        <p>Our refreshment stops were numerous, from a sullen
        place in the highlands to a friendly noodle shop/gambling
        den in a lively highway strip, run by the village sissy.
        His black-and-red striped outfit matched his streaked
        hair and heavily made-up face. We ate his excellent pho
        as we watched the travelling broom salesman come through
        town in his heavily-laden truck. Nearly every household
        bought at least one. From the sorry look of the broom-nub
        formerly employed by our host(ess), it had been quite a
        while since the broom man had last passed through these
        parts. </p>
        <p>From our last refreshment stop &#150;a decidedly
        unfriendly place where we drank up most of their
        supplies&#151;it was still over forty kilometers to our
        goal. But either the wind changed, the road continued to
        descend, or we found untapped energy reserves. We cranked
        all the way into town. Rustic rattan hovels gave way to
        more prosperous-looking wooden homes, and the occasional
        car (often a Mercedes) graced the road. People rode
        alongside us on their motorcycles, wanting to practice
        their few phrases of English. A little further on and we
        were in the heart of Savannakhet&#146;s industrial
        corridor. I realized I was wrong in assuming that all of
        Laos&#146; industry was concentrated on the road between
        Vientiane and Nong Khai (where one finds the
        nation&#146;s brewery and the only soft drink bottling
        plant in the land). Indeed, Savannakhet looks more
        happening than the capital in many ways. Lots of new
        buildings going up, signs announcing joint ventures with
        Korea, Thailand, Vietnam and China. </p>
        <p>Finding the town&#146;s relatively abandoned center
        proved a little difficult, but after only a few wrong
        turns we were pedaling through the crumbling remnants of
        French colonial glory. Like almost every other town
        we&#146;ve seen in Laos, Savannakhet seems to be frozen
        in time, though not at any specific era. At the
        pretentiously-named Auberge du Paradis (where Ly had
        recommended we stay) a guy leaned out the window from
        upstairs, a <i>falang</i>, telling us the place was fully
        booked. He was part of a Danish team building the road
        south to Pakse, and they had taken over the whole hotel. </p>
        <p>So we made the rounds, systematically visiting each of
        Savan&#146;s premier lodging establishments. The best
        deal by far seemed to be the Nanhai Hotel, owned and
        operated by Chinese. Rather than committing right away,
        we continued on to the decidedly less fabulous
        Phonepaseuth, where a brash young girl &#150;sexy in a
        plump sort of way&#151;surprised us by speaking perfect
        American English. She said her name was Tina and that
        she&#146;d spent four years in Maryland. Did she know our
        friends Ly and Caroline from France? We thought this
        might be the swimming pool they come to every day&#133;
        &quot;Oh, you mean the ones with red hair who come on
        bicycles every day? They&#146;re at the pool now, right
        across the street.&quot;</p>
        <p>After commenting on our dirt-encrusted, malodorous
        states, <i>les soeurs Phouthavy</i> accompanied us back
        to the Chinese place and then on to their ancestral home
        &#150;down an abysmally surfaced road. After brief
        introductions to their mom &#150;whom I haven&#146;t seen
        in eight years&#151;and their frail, toothless
        octogenarian grandfather, we made our way by foot to what
        we instantly came to call &quot;Les Champs Elysees&quot;
        of Savannakhet &#150;a scruffy boulevard with former
        pretentions of <i>grandeur</i>. Fred and I gulped down
        noodles with vegetables and juice freshly squeezed by a
        Spice Girl lookalike. (&quot;Lao Spice&quot; we call her,
        and she has since become a local landmark for us). </p>
        <p>Since it was Saturday night, we felt obliged to get a
        glimpse of Savannakhet&#146;s fabled nightlife. And the
        girls reluctantly accompanied us to the Lucky Bar, where
        everyone was watching television when we entered. But as
        soon as they saw us, the tv was switched off and the band
        struck up, playing syrupy Lao-Viet pop. Seated around us
        in the dark were tables and tables full of bar girls, who
        would no doubt have hassled us if Ly and Caroline
        weren&#146;t accompanying us. The next place we visited
        was a little more happening, but by then it was nearing
        eleven p.m. (bars close here at 11:30) and all four of us
        felt ready for bed. </font></p>

        Savannakhet (f)</b><p>Trying to sum-up our stay in
        Savannakhet is no easy affair. How would you describe an
        utterly relaxing few days with no touristic value
        whatsoever? It was sort of like coming home to your
        hometown but never having been there before. I&#146;d
        compare it to living on the television set of Mayberry
        RFD, the sixties television show featuring Andy Williams
        and the then youthful Ron Howard were it filmed and
        conceived in Asia. Part of it was the ease with which Ly
        and Caroline&#146;s family adopted us. Aunt Bee (Madame
        Phouthavy), the girls&#146; mom, doted upon us, fed us
        and welcomed our presence at every meal. </p>
        <p>For us it was the first home-stay like experience
        we&#146;d had for sometime and it was vastly appreciated.
        For them, I am not sure. Perhaps it was a little
        diversion from the trials of being back in Laos for an
        extended period of time. Madame Phouthav&#146;s mother
        (the girls&#146; grandmother) had died recently and
        they&#146;d come back for the internment and to take care
        of their ninety-ish grandfather. He was scarcely able to
        take care of himself and they were preparing to usher him
        back to France with them when they ran into yards of
        French red-tape. </p>
        <p>Our days were largely spent puttering around the
        provincial capital, eating, shopping and answering the
        seemingly unending calls of <i>s&#146;bai dii</i> from
        the town&#146;s children. Another time-sink was eating
        ice cream at the well-stocked Chinese 7-11 and marveling
        at the vast array of goods there. </p>
        <p>The town itself is charming and in the midst of some
        sort of a transition. It sits on the Mekong across from a
        medium-sized Thai town that would like to be the gateway
        to Vietnam. The Thais have gone so far as to propose yet
        another bridge across the Mekong and the improvement of
        the road that leaves from Savannahkhet to Lao Bao in
        Vietnam. The center of Savannakhet is sleepy commercially
        (so the locals say) due to the relocation of the market
        to the outskirts of town. One wonders if it was ever
        bustling. Decaying buildings of colonial design line the
        potholed streets of the center. </p>
        <p>One is the Phouthavy ancestral home. A standard Asian
        affair with a large covered terrace on the street, with
        shop quarters in front and large living area in back and
        upstairs. The Phoutavies moved here after Ly&#146;s
        grandfather mistakenly donated their older and more
        luxurious house to the Vietnamese Club of the town. He
        did so after securing passage for his family to France,
        only to have second thoughts, and found that he could not
        reclaim their former home from the Vietnamese. Sadly, the
        well-placed stately old home houses a shabby little bar
        across from the club. The newer house gave the BikeBrats
        a peek at Asian life. Still, even after a few days of
        hanging out, I still don&#146;t understand the concept of
        Asian public, private and commercial space as the
        Phouthavy lifestyle is partially polluted by their long
        stay in Europe.</p>
        <p>We had reason to visit the cause of the slowdown of
        central Savannahkhet, the new market. There we were
        looking for t-shirts to replace the worn ones of our
        current wardrobe. The gleaming new four-story building
        has many vacancies on the first floor and the others have
        yet to open. The new market sports (perhaps the only)
        escalators that have yet to be put into service therefore
        use of the upper floors is impossible.</p>
        <p>Ly&#146;s brother Sak helped us seek repairs for my
        ailing rear wheel. I&#146;d broken two spokes and damaged
        three others when my rear derailleur malfunctioned and
        over-shifted. Finding new ones to replace the now
        defective ones was proving to be difficult. The friend of
        Sak had all the tools and parts necessary and quickly
        replaced the spokes and trued the wheel. He even rotated
        the tires on both bikes and adjusted our brakes, spending
        some two hours of his time. Afterwards he would only
        charge 2000 kip for his services (less than sixty cents).
        I tried to overpay by double and he wouldn&#146;t hear of
        it. He was just happy to help two guys who had taken the
        time to see his country by bike. I couldn&#146;t let his
        generosity pass so we finally figured that he needed a
        special tool and promised to send it to him when we
        return to the States. I was relieved we&#146;d solved one
        of my worries upon entering Laos. One problem still
        remains: the two itchy but benign (I hope) lumps on my
        right eyelid.</p>
        <p>The Phouthavy extended family includes a man named Ti
        Noy (who we immediately nick-named Nit-Noy after the Thai
        television character he resembles). Ti Noy took care of
        their grandparents while they were away in France and has
        been helping look after their granddad since the
        departure of their grandmother. He is quick to smile and
        has an affable and happy demeanor. He treated us to an
        evening at the local nightclub/hooker bar where he sang a
        Vietnamese number with the band. The place was packed and
        the dance floor filled with each number. One dance was an
        elaborate line dance that was performed by the working
        girls of the crowd and a very drunken patron. Andy and I
        wondered how he managed to perform the intricate steps
        when he could scarcely walk across the bar or sit in a
        chair. He almost came to blows with the staff when asked
        to leave. We all feared his potential rage especially
        since he donned an army uniform and handcuffs, and I
        hoped he didn&#146;t have a revolver tucked somewhere
        underneath his clothes.</p>
        <p>There was an especially funny bookendish pair of
        waiters (or was it waitresses) at the bar. Both sported
        black pants, starched white shirts, spit-shined shoes,
        black vests, black bow ties and shortish haircuts. One
        was extremely masculine, lumbering through the bar
        carrying hugely loaded trays to awaiting customers. The
        other twin was dainty, took small steps, wrists
        fluttering in the breeze, head tossed from side-to-side
        and hips swayed luxuriously while walking. They had utter
        disregard for their respective genders; the mannish one
        was a girl and the queen was, of course, a queen. Ti Noy
        was the M.C. at our table and he filled our glasses with
        beer each time we sipped from them, rendering us
        unconscious of how much we were drinking. One fortunate
        thing is that the bars always close at 11:30 in Laos, so
        we managed to walk home relatively sober despite Ti
        Noy&#146;s earnest efforts.</p>
        <p>What was to be our last day in S-khet was also the
        departure date for Ly and her brother Sak. Though
        we&#146;d planned to have breakfast with them before they
        left Andy awoke feeling very badly and we stayed at the
        hotel in order to nurse him back to health. We managed to
        walk across town to the Phouthavy residence just before
        lunch trying not to fall into one of the cavernous
        potholes the spot the route from our hotel to their
        house. The rain from the last days had filled each with
        Mekong colored water and we dashed along the avenue
        dodging trucks, motorcycles, <i>tuk-tuks</i>, bicycles
        and cars that threatened to splash us with the muddy
        mess. The Phouthavies tried to help Andy by rubbing
        scented oil into his achy back to no avail. Despite
        Andy&#146;s condition we went off to the dock to see Sak
        and Ly off to Thailand to begin their epic journey home.
        Ly seemed sad to leave her mom, sister, grandfather and
        homeland behind. I felt a little sad and empty seeing
        them board the long tail boat and motor across the
        Mekong.</p>
        <p>Later I dropped by to say goodbye to Madame Phouthavy,
        Caroline and Granddad with some flowers for the shrine to
        their grandmother and some antibiotics for
        Caroline&#146;s ailing stomach. As we embraced and kissed
        goodbye I again became heavy-hearted and wondered when
        we&#146;d have such hospitality and good times again.
        With Andy not feeling well it might very well be the next
        day.</font></p>

        Postscript</b><p>At about eight in the evening
        Andy&#146;s fever peaked and he lay in his bed at our
        Chinese hotel. Tinoy managed to find a doctor who&#146;d
        make a hotel call and the two arrived at our elegant
        suite to assess Andy&#146;s condition. The Vietnamese
        doctor diagnosed the malady as the flu and insisted on
        giving him some intravenous vitamins --much to
        Andy&#146;s (needle-hating) chagrin. He moaned and
        perspired all night and insisted that we find a new hotel
        the next day. Andy wanted a hot bath to sooth his aching
        bones.</p>
        <p>We found the office of Andy&#146;s doctor, who
        reaffirmed his diagnosis of the flu via a blood test that
        eliminated malaria and dengue fever as possibilities.
        More vitamins were administered and he was sent away to
        rest. I made an appointment to have my eyelid lanced that
        afternoon. Andy&#146;s flu left us pinned down in
        charming and Mayberry-like S-khet another three days.
        Slow and muddy might better describe the town, for I
        began to get bored of our stay here. Through his
        suffering Andy kept apologizing for being sick and
        keeping us here which only made me feel more guilty about
        being bored. One day while riding around running errands
        I met another cyclist. I&#146;d stopped at an Asian 7-11
        for an ice cream for Andy when we saw each other.</p>
        <p>Jo had been a VSO (Volunteer Service Organization of
        Britain) employee in Indonesia for the past two years and
        was now taking some time to see more of the region by
        bike. It was hard to peg her actual nationality from her
        accent. Born in England, lived in Germany, the USA and
        Indonesia. She had cycled (and bussed) the past few days
        from Pakse on what is supposed to be one of the most
        miserable roads in Laos, alone. She told me of her days
        in the driving rain, soaked to the bone and wondering why
        she was riding at all. After one especially grimy and
        muddy day she arrived at a guesthouse and the owner just
        handed her the garden hose without saying a word, leaving
        her to rinse the muck off of herself and her bike.</p>
        <p>She was having trouble with her gears and we spent an
        afternoon together working on them, lunching and
        exchanging travel stories. It was through her that I was
        introduced into the cyling segment S-khet NGO ex-pat
        crowd. She mentioned that some people she&#146;d met went
        on a bike ride each Sunday. At the time I dismissed the
        idea summarily. Andy and I would surely be on the road by
        then. I&#146;d underestimated the severity of his
        influenza. </p>
        <p>Come Saturday we realized a weekend departure was
        impossible. Andy was still too weak to ride and no busses
        would be departing until Monday. I called Eric, the
        friend of the friend of Jo, and introduced myself. They
        were planning to ride on Sunday and had a fourth of July
        celebration on the calendar for that evening. We were
        invited to both if we wanted. Andy was just beginning to
        feel better and he&#146;d join us for dinner. Before the
        festivities I went over to help them try to fix yet
        another set of bicycle gears and Andy hung out with
        Caroline at our hotel for another backgammon lesson. The
        dinner consisted of a relatively tough little steak and
        some overdone French fries but the company was good even
        if we forgot to toast the Stars and Stripes that night.</p>
        <p>The alarm rang the next day at a frightfully early
        hour; I&#146;d become accustomed to sleeping until seven.
        Five-thirty seemed inhuman. Somehow I choked down a
        yogurt, crackers and water, mounted my bike and was on my
        way to meet the other riders. At Eric&#146;s we joined
        Bas (short for Sebastian), Bruce and Margaret all on
        their mountain bikes and ready to go. Bas is Dutch, from
        Utrecht, was riding the hobbled bike I failed to repair
        the day before. Bruce and Margaret, in their (this is an
        estimate) fifties, from New Zealand were almost a little
        too cheery for the early hour; however their mirth was
        somewhat inspiring. Sleepy S-khet was even more so on a
        lazy Sunday after a night of World Cup Soccer. Bas was
        dragging a little low in the saddle from a late night
        watching the Dutch play.</p>
        <p>I was a little worried for they warned me that
        there&#146;d be more than a little loose sand and gravel
        on the ride and my steed was clearly not configured for
        that type of ride. True to their warning, within just a
        few kilometers of our start we were sloshing through mud
        and riding along a sandy dike precariously perched over
        picturesque rice fields. I felt like I might lose
        traction at any moment and plunge a few meters headfirst
        into a mucky patch but Siegfried was stable and sure
        through even the most difficult terrain. As we traversed <i>bans</i>
        villagers looked on with a little surprise, unlike those
        we&#146;d passed on the road. I could only surmise that
        they had seen this crew cycling through the woods before
        and were beyond shock and amazement --or it was just too
        early in the morning and they considered it a
        hallucination or dream?</p>
        <p>Our first break had us resting at a very rural <i>wat</i>
        that featured an ancient stupa and some sculpture. Eric
        commented that he was unsure where the locals had found
        inspiration for the carved stone lion, as there are none
        in Laos or anywhere nearby. The stupa itself was enclosed
        behind a low stone wall that had recently been adorned by
        light poles. Those who had added the lighting had taken
        no consideration of the site when attaching blue PVC
        tubing to the cement in order to house the wires for the
        lights. Adding an extra unsightly touch the tubing was
        attached to the railing using big chrome bands. Margaret
        and Bruce took on a parental role at this stop, passing
        out snacks and encouragement, citing that Eric invariably
        &quot;bonks&quot; after about twenty kilometers if they
        don&#146;t feed him.</p>
        <p>We forded another two or three more mucky channels and
        set off through the forest to ride around a swampy lake.
        I was feeling great; it was the first time being on a
        bike in nearly a week. Better still I was unburdened and
        unhassled by any traffic except the occasional water
        buffalo, cow, or mystified villager. I lost focus while
        zipping along the sandy path through the dense forest,
        hit a loose bit of sand, slid sideways and dumped my bike
        in the bushes. No harm at all, dusted myself off and hit
        the trail again. We had to stop periodically to hoist our
        bikes over tumbled trees blocking our path before winding
        around the lake and finally rejoining the road south back
        to S-khet. It made me feel strong to have the pavement
        tumble beneath my wheels as we raced against the wind
        back to town. Bas and I pumped as hard as we could down a
        hill and up the other side leaving the others behind.
        Bas, though feeling a little out of shape at the moment,
        would ride road races back in Holland and boasted of
        completing one race that took him 270 kilometers in one
        day. It was clear that he had strong legs as he kept pace
        with me on a mountain bike with bad gears.</p>
        <p>We only rode some five kilometers on Highway 13 before
        turning off towards the Mekong on a still sandier track.
        We stopped for another rest at a village that sported an
        image of a standing buddha some five meters tall. Eric
        remarked that it was obviously from the &#145;70&#146;s,
        the 1970&#146;s&quot; he further clarified. &quot;It
        looks distinctly like John Travolta in &#145;Saturday
        Night Fever&#146;&quot; he added. Just a few moments
        later we pulled into the compound and gardens of Bruce
        and Margaret&#146;s home on the Mekong. Eric had goaded
        the two to host us for coffee at their house after the
        ride, adding to the parental ambience of the morning.
        Their huge and sweeping lawn reached to the shore of the
        muddy rain-swollen waters of the mighty river. Upon
        arrival it took me ten minutes to hose off my bike and
        myself I was so encrusted with dirt.</p>
        <p>Eric left us early to attend a marriage of a friend
        (and I think, ex). Bruce joked with him that
        &quot;he&#146;d let another good one slip by&quot; and
        that he was simply &quot;not a closer.&quot; This was one
        of the subplots of the morning; it seems that Eric has
        tired of his &quot;own cooking&quot; and is seeking some
        companionship of the female persuasion. After Eric left,
        Margaret trotted out all of her imported delicacies and
        told us how dear the peanut butter was, &quot;so use it
        sparingly!&quot; I went directly for the bread and
        tamarind jam first before smearing a fresh and crusty
        French roll with chunky style and a banana for good
        measure. I tore myself away from the table and excused
        myself before eating them out of house and home.</p>
        <p>Later that afternoon Caroline poked her head in at the
        inn to see how Andy was doing, only this time she could
        only stand at the door and peek into the room. It seemed
        that yesterday&#146;s backgammon lesson &quot;alone with
        a white guy in a hotel room&quot; had inspired more than
        just a few rumors about her morals amongst the
        Savannahkhetans. We socialized on the patio of our room
        under the watchful eyes of the hotel personnel before
        going back to Bruce and Margaret Jefferies for a sunset
        upon the Mekong. Again more delicacies showed up at our
        table as the partly cloudy skies changed from silver to
        gold and then rose. Margaret pulled out her homemade
        chicken liver paté, imported crackers, snacks and
        roasted peanuts while Bruce pulled imported beer from
        their Cadillac sized turquoise-colored refrigerator. </p>
        <p>Before the sky turned dark Caroline had to excuse
        herself; her mother insisted on her being home before
        dark to protect her recently sullied reputation. In
        advance of her departure she&#146;d caught the attention
        of Eric, who was still stung by his loss of his ex. Andy
        hit his energy wall and also excused himself, leaving me
        to try to keep up with Bruce and Eric consuming mass
        quantities of beer. </p>
        <p>In reviewing our dinner possibilities I realized that
        we had a pretty good understanding of S-khet. I knew all
        of the restaurants they mentioned and there was only one
        I hadn&#146;t been to. One that was vetoed as a
        possibility Andy and I had eaten at before. Its host had
        been a lounge singer in Paris during the 70&#146;s. On
        every wall were photos of him in various cliché poses in
        front of monuments there. Then, like now, he sported a
        big head of well blow-dried black hair that made him look
        like an Asian version of the King himself. Eric and the
        others called his place Elvis&#146; in honor of the
        resemblance and we knew exactly where he was talking
        about on only the mention of the nick-name. </p>
        <p>Tonight, at around midnight, we&#146;ll get on a
        well-worn bus and make the bumpy journey to Vietnam (I
        hope). Andy still doesn&#146;t have the energy to ride
        and we are dreadfully behind schedule to make our meeting
        with my friend Wendy in Hanoi. Strangely I think
        I&#146;ll miss my so-called life here in S-khet. The kids
        have tired of yelling <i>falang</i> at me as I pass by on
        my bike or on foot to the point I almost feel anonymous.
        One last anecdote before I close out our writings on this
        the second largest town in Laos.</p>
        <p>People don&#146;t walk in Savannahkhet. If I walk down
        the street everyone stops and stares in disbelief. Why
        would a rich white person not ride in a shiny new Land
        Cruiser or motorbike? At least a bicycle? I realized
        where I stand on the social ladder when walking a few
        days ago. The only other person <i>a pied</i> was walking
        his water buffalo through town. </font></p>
