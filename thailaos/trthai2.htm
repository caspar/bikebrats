        to Chat Trakan, 133km (f)</b><p>Heavy clouds blanketed
        the morning sky, casting a gray pale on everything. Only
        my yellow tinted sunglasses cut through the glare and
        somehow brightened the day that started with a
        miscommunication between Andy and me. And with our
        limited Thai, Andy and I weren&#146;t the only ones who
        had trouble understanding one another today... </p>
        <p>The really interesting thing about the morning was my
        realization of the scale of rice production in Thailand.
        We rode past acres and acres of huge fields filled with
        heavy equipment dealing with the production of this
        staple. Still the Thais rely on tested and true
        methodologies like letting ducks forage for the rice that
        the harvesters missed. The only difference, again, is the
        scale. Instead of a single herder watching after a dozen
        or so ducks as we saw in Indonesia there were tens of
        herders with thousands of the little feathered (and
        tasty!) beasts.</p>
        <p>Thai was coming to us as easily as Polish had in
        Eastern Europe, so asking for directions and following
        road signs was not as easy as it could have been. Most
        conversations resulted in both of us being confused and
        somewhat frustrated. Judging from the number of giggles
        elicited, some of our questions must be pretty funny.
        This day all of our three maps had different roads and
        towns listed so we were doubly (or perhaps triply)
        confused. Though the clouds stayed with us through just
        before lunch we were hot and tired by the time we
        stopped. We lunched and played backgammon at a little
        food stall while the owner broadcast his boombox and his
        croonings over a huge public address system throughout
        the town which was little more than a crossroads.</p>
        <p>There were fifty or more kilometers to go and the day
        had gotten hotter not cooler while we rested.</p>
        <p>Just a few hundred meters from town another
        miscommunication resulted in a blow-up between Andy and
        me that was so profound we weren&#146;t even speaking
        with one another. A few yards later and we&#146;d
        resolved it, we wouldn&#146;t ride together again ever
        and split up our common belongings. We met a few times
        during the next kilometers with the same result. Some
        thirty kilometers down the road at a crossroads we met
        again and decided to ride together to Chat Trakan and
        come up with an amicable solution when we had cooled down
        and had a shower. In Chat Trakan we were told there was
        no place to stay in town, only in the National Park ten
        kilometers away. </p>
        <p>Our long ride and argument had eaten up the daylight
        and we&#146;d be hard-pressed to make ten more clicks
        before dark. Luckily on the edge of town we found an
        industrial-strength <i>tuk-tuk</i> and hired it to take
        us the remainder of the way. When we reached the park we
        were told that there was no place to stay and only after
        insisting some cabins became available. At first the
        commander of the National Park Outpost demanded 500 baht
        for the night. We were in no position to barter but I did
        anyway and got the price down to 400 for the mosquito
        ridden wood hut near a waterfall. After having a wash we
        walked into a village a few kilometers away and found a
        storeowner who cooked us some noodles while we talked
        about the day&#146;s misunderstandings. A little <i>udon</i>
        and egg later we had pretty much patched things up and
        would ride again the next day.</font><font size="2"></p>
        <p><em><font face="Arial">(If you hadn&#146;t realized,
        this is a really glossed over version of what was one of
        the worst days of any of our rides. At least we are now
        laughing about some of the petty and angry things.)</font></em></font></p>

        <td><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>12 June, Chat Trakan
        to Dan Sai, 98km (a)</b><p>It could have been the
        oppressive heat, or the residue of our arguments that had
        kept me up all night, but I think the <i>tokeh</i> was to
        blame. The word is the same in Thai and Indonesian, and
        refers to a large species of gecko with an even larger
        mating call. After many months in Southeast Asia,
        we&#146;ve grown pretty much accustomed to their
        nighttime cries, but last night&#146;s <i>tokeh </i>didn&#146;t
        budge from its station inches from our window, and its
        cry was peculiarly flat; was it sick, brain-damaged,
        speaking another dialect? </p>
        <p>Whatever the case, I was hardly a bundle of energy
        this morning, my second in a row without coffee. Rather
        than hop right onto our bikes, we decided to check out
        the nearby waterfall on foot. It was a sturdy little hike
        at such an early hour, but well-rewarded with a view of a
        perfect little waterfall spilling down a concave cliff
        into a natural swimming pool. </p>
        <p>The pedal back down through the valley to town
        &#150;ten kilometers away&#151;was exhilarating in the
        golden morning light and relative cool. Children on their
        way to school jammed every conveyance, the braver ones
        yelling &quot;hello&quot; to us. Breakfast was a plate of
        tasty fried rice for me, and a spoonful for Fred. I found
        myself feeling genuine concern over his lack of appetite.
        It had been three days since he&#146;d eaten a proper
        meal and his scrawny body must be burning up all his
        reserve calories with all the riding we&#146;ve been
        doing. </p>
        <p>We groaned in unison on our way out of town when we
        passed an attractive little building with a sign in
        front. &quot;Guest House&quot; it said, eliciting instant
        fantasies of the night that could have been, in a
        comfortable bed, in a cool room, a real meal in our
        bellies. Minutes later, Chat Trakan had disappeared and
        we were surrounded by totally gorgeous countryside,
        pedaling through a verdant valley bordered by jagged
        cliffs. I thought to myself how I could bike through
        Thailand forever and never tire of it. </p>
        <p>This sentiment changed radically, however, as we
        toiled over twenty-some kilometers of gravel road, in the
        process of being upgraded. I did what I normally do when
        enduring unpleasant riding situations, namely, shut off
        my brain. My thoughts were jarred back to reality only
        while climbing a particularly steep hill, riding over
        bone-rattling bumps, or being hailed by friendly members
        of the road crew &#150;who yelled at us: <i>&quot;Pai nai
        khap?&quot;</i> (where are you going?). After over an
        hour of inhaling red road dust and submitting my taint to
        unspeakable tortures, I thought to myself that I was
        really ready for the road construction to end. As if on
        cue, pavement reappeared, smooth new heavenly pavement
        that made the last kilometers into Nakhon Thai a
        pleasure. On our way into town we passed a sign marked
        &quot;Get House&quot; and I proposed to Fred that we stop
        for a nap to avoid riding in the noontime heat. He agreed
        in a heartbeat, and soon we found ourselves in a simple
        little room with a wobbly ceiling fan. </p>
        <p>We were already awake when the alarm rang at
        two-thirty, sweaty and hungry. Outside in the sunshine it
        felt like a blast furnace. While enjoying a late lunch at
        the bustling little town&#146;s main intersection (Fred
        ordered a small plate of steamed rice and barely gave it
        a nibble), we were surprised to see a <i>farang</i> pull
        up across the street on a motorcycle. Like all whitefolk
        we&#146;ve been seeing on the road, it was a male of the
        species, overweight and accompanied by a young Thai girl
        &#150;only in this case the girl was massively pregnant.
        We ambled over to say hello, and friendly Jean-Pierre
        introduced himself, a permasmile affixed to his pudgy
        face. He said he split his time between Switzerland and a
        little village several kilometers to the west of Nakhon
        Thai. He presented his wife, Nit and told us that the
        longer he spends in Thailand, the less he understands
        about the place. He thought we were nuts to be riding in
        such heat (&quot;normally it doesn&#146;t get this
        hot,&quot; he said &#150;to encourage us?) and Nit kept
        wishing us a &quot;good holiday!&quot; </p>
        <p>The road out of town was meltingly hot. I had
        neglected to fill my water bottles, and our first
        attempts to find cold water were unsuccessful.
        Convenience store fridges were opened to reveal Coke,
        Fanta and any number of Thai energy drinks, all of which
        fall under the generic term &quot;<i>nam</i>&quot;,
        meaning water. This was frustrating, since we&#146;d had
        no problem finding actual H2O anywhere else, and today
        was when we (or at least I) needed it the most. Finally,
        at about the sixth stop, we caught a glimpse of some
        familiar plastic water bottles in the back of a fridge,
        right after the shopkeeper had told us he didn&#146;t
        have any (&quot;<i>mi mai</i>&quot;). Guzzling down the
        precious liquid in giant gulps, we noticed dark clouds
        approaching and heard ominous thunderclaps. Had we known
        what lay ahead we probably would have turned back, but
        instead we blithely pedaled off up the hill-studded
        valley. </p>
        <p>At first the climb seemed manageable. It followed the
        course of a mountain stream, alternately jumping skywards
        and flattening off. But after a few kilometers like this
        the incline became steadier, relentless even. Motorists
        would pass us giving the thumbs-up sign, to which I was
        tempted to respond with a thumbs-out sign, begging for a
        lift into town. This sentiment deepened as fat raindrops
        began to fall. When a bright rainbow began to form in the
        sky ahead of us, I took it as a sign that we were nearing
        the summit &#150;a fantasy which gave me the strength to
        push on. When we finally did reach the top, I noticed how
        cool it had gotten. How high had we climbed anyway? After
        a brief argument concerning the disparity of our loads
        (I&#146;ll admit to mild crankiness here), we were
        rewarded with a breathtaking ten-kilometer swoop all the
        way into Dan Sai, where we had no trouble locating the
        tiny town&#146;s only lodging opportunity. Located behind
        a nondescript Thai-style strip mall, our rest stop for
        the night was in a brand-spanking-new motel-style place.
        The manager of the place, a young woman who also ran a
        tailor shop in the strip mall, spoke one sentence of
        English of which she seemed immensely proud. &quot;Room
        air 500 baht, room no air 400 baht,&quot; she repeated
        several times as if she had been waiting months for the
        opportunity to practice the phrase. While the prices
        seemed a bit out of bounds, we went whole hog and
        rewarded the day&#146;s sweaty efforts with air
        conditioning. It felt like heaven. </font></p>

        <td><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>13 June, Dan Sai to
        Kaeng Khut Khu, 131km (f)</b><p>Our night in the Thai
        version of a Motel 6 was hardly restful for me. My
        stomach was still acting up, the crackling noise the
        plastic wrapping over the mattress made and the constant
        wail of dogs fighting outside combined to make it a
        restless night. Still when the alarm went off at 5:30 we
        dutifully arose, packed and departed. Regrettably we made
        a wrong choice for breakfast. It took over an hour for
        our restaurant to prepare fried rice. They&#146;d run out
        of eggs and sent their daughter down the street for a new
        supply. She must have forgotten to leave breadcrumbs for
        herself in order to find the way home because it took a
        very long time for her to return. My still-sour stomach
        tolerated the meal better than the last days, and for
        that I was happy.</p>
        <p>While we were waiting we took advantage of the time to
        try out our ever-expanding Thai vocabulary with the owner
        of the café and his family. His wife found our
        dictionary/phrasebook especially amusing. </p>
        <p>The first kilometers after breakfast rolled easily
        underneath Siegfried and Roy. The wind blew us along over
        gently rolling terrain up a broad valley past various
        crops and jungle. It was apparent that we were in the
        sticks because more and more people left their houses
        walked outside and stared at us as we passed. Some were
        brave enough to say &quot;hello&quot;; thankfully, none
        said &quot;hello mister.&quot; </p>
        <p>We stopped for a drink in a little village store in
        Pak Man at around 8:30 and within a few moments of
        arriving a drunken dude invited Andy for a beer. The
        staff at the store knew him well and brought him a tall
        Singha before he even asked. He identified himself as the
        village English teacher and set forth to prove his
        command of the language. I couldn&#146;t really tell if
        he was completely inept in our mother tongue or just too
        drunk to speak. We didn&#146;t linger to find out, opting
        to hit the road before it got too hot to ride.</p>
        <p>Soon after the sun was high in the sky and trying to
        burn a hole in our helmets. From the map it appeared that
        we&#146;d be traveling down the Heung River, across which
        you could spit into Laos. If you are an avid BikeBrats
        reader you know that down-river is usually a good thing.
        In this case the valley was steep and the river wild so
        the road had to cut up and down the sides of the canyon,
        leaving us huffing and puffing up steep grades and
        whizzing down sharp descents, dodging potholes in the
        element-ravaged road.</p>
        <p>We&#146;d intended to make this a very short day,
        resting in Pak Huay at a guesthouse there. When we
        arrived around noon we had trouble finding the
        accommodation but did successfully find a riverside
        restaurant. After lunch we found the loose collection of
        substandard plastic-lined huts and decided that we&#146;d
        press on (and press our luck) to Chiang Khan. In a
        misunderstanding we managed to leave town without a full
        set of water bottles and found ourselves twenty
        kilometers down one of the most challenging, hot and
        deserted roads we&#146;ve ever experienced without water.
        Luckily we landed a few meters later on the outskirts of
        a backwards village where we managed to find something
        cold to drink and directions to Chiang Khan. We were back
        to being an out and out curiosity again. The entire
        village came out to gawk at our sweaty dirty
        brattishness. All the girls giggled, pointed at us and
        made fun of our Thai and general boorishness.</p>
        <p>We made it back to civilization a few kilometers
        closer to Chiang Kahn. More farms and folks appeared by
        the road as the terrain became less rugged. By just
        before dusk we&#146;d arrived exhausted. Though Chiang
        Khan was a cute little Mekong-side trading village we
        opted to go a little further south to a bend in the river
        for a comfort fix in the form of an air-conditioned
        bungalow on the river. After a dinner and ice cream in
        the night air we collapsed after one of the most
        challenging cycling days since the Texas Hill Country.</font></p>

        <td><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>15 June, Kaeng Khut
        Khu to Sang Khorn, 105km (a)</b><p>Looking out over the
        mesmerizing expanse of the Mekong and gnawing on an
        energy bar at five-thirty this morning, I could think of
        little besides clambering back into bed. But once we had
        climbed back into the saddle and were whirring down the
        road I felt revitalized, energized from a full day of
        torpor (and sleep) in which we never wandered more than a
        hundred meters from our miniature riverside bungalow. It
        was a beautiful day and it felt fantastic to be back on
        the road. </p>
        <p>We cranked through villages full of the familiar sight
        of uniformed kids on their way to school, who would
        interrupt their renditions of the distressingly
        ubiquitous World Cup song (if heterosexuality ever had an
        anthem, this would be it) to scream
        &quot;HELLOHELLOHELLO&quot; at us. Others would just
        shout &quot;<i>farang</i>&quot; (foreigner of European
        descent) to alert their friends and families of our
        passage --most likely to be the most talked-about event
        of the day. Fred thought these villages looked more
        prosperous than the others we&#146;ve seen lately, but
        most of the housing looked pretty basic to me. I suppose
        in comparison to some of the villages discernible across
        the river in Laos, the Thai side looked like Switzerland.
        </p>
        <p>Our largely shaded road squiggled right along the
        ever-wider river, seeking the highest points along its
        banks to avoid flooding in the rainy season (and not
        always succeeding, we were able to deduce from the
        road&#146;s often washed-out surface). For many
        kilometers it was hard to make out the river from its
        vast swampy riverbed, and we wondered out loud what a
        sight it would be to see the river swell after a heavy
        rain. </p>
        <p>In spite of numerous hills and without the aid of a
        tailwind, our average speed kept climbing through the
        day, peaking at 23.4km/hr (meaningless to you,
        astonishing to us). We made the usual stops at Thai-style
        seven-elevens, gulping down water and perusing the
        contents of the ice cream chest. I think Fred had his
        first icecreamy treat at something like seven-thirty,
        while I held off until at least nine. I should note here
        how these roadside groceries are all essentially the same
        both aesthetically and experientially. All are housed in
        garage-looking buildings that double as the
        shopkeepers&#146; homes. The living quarters are always
        clearly visible behind the shop, and the two spaces are
        never really delineated from each other. One or more
        glass-fronted cases of cold beverages are prominently
        displayed, while suspended from bits of twine hang
        various junk food items, household supplies, dried
        squids, candy and auto parts. Without fail a terrazzo
        picnic table graces the area in front of the shop, but as
        this is usually in the sun, we tend to loiter in the
        shade under a metal canopy just outside, next to tables
        holding eggs, motor oil, shallots, chilies, and
        houseplants. I can&#146;t recall an instance where the
        proprietor of the shop hasn&#146;t dragged out a pair of
        chairs or stools for us to sit on. The consistency of the
        experience is really quite amazing, uncanny even, making
        it very difficult to remember any specific stop, only the
        general experience. Usually we sit for a good quarter of
        an hour &#150;longer if we&#146;re severely
        overheated&#151;making feeble attempts at communication
        with our gracious host (all we&#146;ve really mastered in
        Thai are the numbers), providing entertainment for any
        villagers who happen by. </p>
        <p>These stops tend to occur at twenty-to-thirty
        kilometer intervals, so we had already made three or four
        by the time we reached Sang Khorn, our intended stop for
        the night. Seeing a sign marked &quot;Mama&#146;s
        Riverside Lodge&quot; we turned up a dirt road leading to
        nothing but a school. Just as we were about to turn back,
        a squat woman on a motorbike began frantically waving at
        us, pointing out a couple of other <i>farang</i> on
        bikes. We pedaled up to meet Kevin from South Africa,
        Angela from Canada, and Mama herself. They had just been
        watching a performance at the school concerning mosquito
        control. Kevin and Angela were hoping to ride out to the
        waterfall but had flat tires. We whipped out our pumps
        &#150;which weren&#146;t the right flavor, it turns out,
        and queried them about their situation. They had met in
        Taiwan, where both taught English for two years, and were
        now on an extended tour through Asia before moving to
        Japan for more teaching. Mama listened through all this
        before she gave her pitch: &quot;Mama have nice bungalow
        for you, right on river.&quot; We agreed to at least
        check it out and have lunch there. &quot;She&#146;s a
        good cook,&quot; enthused Angela, &quot;but the place is
        a little on the rustic side.&quot;</p>
        <p>Rustic indeed. To get there we had to push our bikes
        through knee-high razor grass and cross a perilously
        flimsy bridge over a gorge. But Mama&#146;s place
        &#150;not much more than a patch of dirt with a few
        crooked huts&#151;did have a great view of the river, and
        while I wouldn&#146;t go out of my way to praise her
        culinary abilities, it was nice to order from a menu
        printed in English. Her personality is what sold us
        though. For someone who runs a guesthouse catering to
        foreigners, her English is appallingly deficient, but we
        found her manic, slightly unbalanced manner completely
        infectious, and as about as much entertainment as one can
        hope to find in a sleepy little village like Sang Khorn. </p>
        <p>Much of the afternoon was spent lazing on the balcony
        of our little two-dollar hut, which featured that most
        prized of amenities: a hammock. When the sun lowered in
        the sky, I went down to the beach-like riverbank to watch
        locals interact with the mighty, muddy current. Kids swam
        noisily; old men fished with nets in the calmer eddies;
        motorboats went back and forth on mysterious missions to
        Laos. I observed a weedy bush full of butterflies for a
        while, then headed up for my fourth shower of the day. </p>
        <p>When night fell, we were surprised that Kevin and
        Angela hadn&#146;t reappeared. Then Mama arrived on her
        motorbike, puffing and sweating, her many layers of
        makeup melting on her face. Waddling up to us, she
        launched into a frantic account of the day&#146;s
        unfortunate events: &quot;Mama go police. <i>Farang</i>
        go waterfall, Thai people steal money, passport African
        boy. So bad so bad. Mama feel bad because Mama no say
        waterfall bad place. Here in village no problem, but
        waterfall many people poor, people steal. You want
        eat?&quot; Here she pointed to Fred and said for the
        twentieth time today, &quot;He too sa-kee-nee&quot; and
        went on to advise him to be careful not to anger me,
        since I could so obviously beat him up. </p>
        <p>After a while Angela and Kevin came moping back to
        camp. We shared a vegetarian dinner with them, listening
        to their woeful tale and offering assistance. I was
        surprised when Kevin lit up a joint right there at the
        dinner table.</p>
        <p>&quot;You don&#146;t think Mama would mind?&quot; I
        asked in a hushed tone.</p>
        <p>&quot;I doubt it, since she&#146;s the one who sold me
        the dope,&quot; Kevin responded in his peculiar accent.
        &quot;Everyone in Nong Khai told us to come here.
        Mama&#146;s dope is famous throughout the Northeast of
        Thailand. She brings it over from Laos.&quot;</p>
        <p>Falling asleep under the mosquito net later, I
        wondered if I&#146;d discovered the key to understanding
        Mama&#146;s peculiar brand of flakiness.</font></p>

        <td><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>16 June, Sang Khorn to
        Nong Khai, 100km (f)</b><p>Mama&#146;s last words before
        I shuffled off to our mosquito ridden hut last night were
        &quot;oh, Mama market at 4:30, so no problem early
        breakfast.&quot; As we were leaving at somewhere around
        7:30 (this is a late BikeBrats start) sweat rolled off of
        my brow, arms and legs. Andy&#146;s burden was just a
        little heavier than normal. Ol, Mama&#146;s grandson, had
        handed him a three-kilogram papaya just after breakfast
        and Mama wrapped it in newspaper and bound it with twine
        to the back rack of Andy&#146;s bike. &quot;It good in
        three or four days. Your take with you to Laos,&quot;
        were her words of goodbye. Andy groaned and I pushed
        ahead in order to cross the very rickety bridge in
        advance of him. I worried that it might collapse under
        the increased burden.</p>
        <p>I couldn&#146;t help but reflect on our stay at
        Mama&#146;s and compare it to the very popular Thai
        television show &quot;Nit Noi&quot;. Literally the
        show&#146;s title means &quot;A little bit&quot;, a
        phrase we are more than familiar with, especially helpful
        when describing our command of the local language. The
        show&#146;s central character is an overweight little boy
        of around ten years. He lives in a little traditional
        village with his grandmother and, strange because most
        television shows feature the rich, is poor. Andy calls it
        a moralistic soap opera. Every episode seems to see Nit
        Noy (we are assuming this is the name of the little fat
        boy) go from glee to despair and back through every
        emotion in-between. Yesterday&#146;s cast of characters
        and set of events could have easily been the plot of one
        of the episodes. On our evening walk through Sang Khorn
        every house we walked by during &quot;Nit Noy&quot; hour
        was tuned to the show and most families were gathered
        around watching. The lyrics and music of the theme song
        of the show are gratingly catchy and we often find
        ourselves humming it or applying new lyrics to it to
        describe a situation or insult one another.</p>
        <p>Off-camera in our installment of &quot;Nit Noy&quot;,
        Andy casually untied the carefully attached papaya (thank
        god the bridge did not collapse beneath him) and I gave
        it to some women who were frantically preparing food at a
        stand. They didn&#146;t even miss a beat, as though a <i>farang</i>
        daily stops by with a giant papaya, the knife cut it and
        it was being grated up for a green papaya salad before we
        had clicked into our cleats and were on our way.</p>
        <p>The rest of the day was a bit of a blur until just
        before our arrival in Nong Khai. What I do remember of it
        was through a gauzy film of sweat and sunscreen. The
        sun&#146;s heat threatened to blister our skin. I spent
        most of the morning in a near coma trying to forget that
        the temperature was hovering just short of 100 and
        humidity boiled from the Mekong. I wouldn&#146;t be
        looking for a sauna when we arrived in Nong Khai. At each
        one of our water stops I did search for some possibility
        of fighting the Cokes for their spot in the fridge. Andy
        solved the problem by opening the door, standing in front
        of the icebox and pretending that he was having trouble
        deciding what to drink. We must have looked disgustingly
        hot and sweaty to the point of scaring people. Most kept
        their distance, and the ones brave enough kept muttering
        the same thing which must have meant &quot;its hot&quot;
        or &quot;eeww, don&#146;t sweat on me&quot;.</p>
        <p>Somewhere along the way the Mekong widened until it
        was nearly a half-mile wide sea. Not unlike hot chocolate
        in color and temperature if not in taste. It rushed by us
        each time we stopped to take in the view of Laos across
        it. It had cut a broad flat valley to flow through so the
        ride leveled out substantially for the last 30 or so
        kilometers, making the ever increasing heat our only
        obstacle to making it someplace cool to shower and rest.
        Wet and irritable, we arrived at the Grand Hotel, where
        fifteen dollars gets you a luxurious room and breakfast
        for two. I tried not to drip sweat on the registration
        form or to notice that there was a pack of GAGs (giggling
        Asian girls) watching my every move. The ecstasy of a
        shower and shave after a tough ride and a few rustic days
        is incomparable. I derive immense satisfaction from
        watching the rivulet of road dirt, sunscreen and sweat
        roll of my body and swirl down the drain only to join the
        similarly colored Mekong.</p>
        <p>Though we arrived at the hotel at just after noon we
        couldn&#146;t be bothered to leave its air-conditioned
        comfort until just before sunset when the temperature was
        finally beginning to dip. Lunching and napping were the
        activities in our afternoon biathlon and even that amount
        of activity seemed a challenge. When we did leave the
        confines of the Grand we realized there was more to this
        border town than we&#146;d thought. Certainly there was
        more traffic, which we dodged with considerable
        difficulty while having our walk about. </p>
        <p>We walked to the Mut Mee guesthouse to find the
        reputed Internet café and try to arrange connecting,
        getting our mail and updating the site. There we met
        Michael, a very young-looking middle aged African
        American --whom I supposed to be a Vietnam veteran--
        playing chess on the floor with a very young Danish boy
        named Kim. After I described our situation to Michael,
        Kim seemed to lose interest in his chess game. He soon
        told us that he&#146;d just gotten back from Laos where
        he&#146;d been cycling. He told us about riding for
        hundreds and hundreds and kilometers there and what to
        expect. He, like Angela and Kevin, described Laotians
        scooping water out of the Mekong boiling it and drinking
        the muddy mess and I flashed back on my shower.</font></p>
