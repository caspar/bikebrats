        <td><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>15 April, Navasota to
        Coldspring, 66 miles</b> </font><p><font size="2" face="Arial">It was odd. Today we traveled towards the
        East all day, but culturally it felt more and more like
        the South, while the landscape provoked Proustian
        memories of my childhood in the North. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">It was a slow start, due
        to the continuing unseasonably cold temperature and the
        poor quality of the morning&#146;s coffee. Once astride
        our saddles, the countryside between Navasota and
        Richards looked identical to the heartland of my native
        Wisconsin, full of green rolling hills and cow-filled
        pastures. It was only when we stopped in the small
        hamlets of Anderson and Richards that this illusion was
        shattered, for we had unmistakably crossed the invisible
        line delineating Redneckland. The general ambience had
        become distinctly Faulknerian &#150;heavy, sweet-smelling
        and sinister. Nearly everyone we encountered eyed us
        suspiciously, even menacingly, and they all drove pickups
        with gun racks visible through the rear windows and
        barking hound dawgs in back. The white menfolk all wore
        coveralls and baseball caps advertising towing services
        and the like, while the black folk averted their gazes
        whenever we would look at them, or timidly wave at us
        from their front porches. In nearly every exchange of the
        day, the only word we could distinguish when addressed by
        someone of either race was &quot;y&#146;all,&quot; to
        which we&#146;d nod our heads and smile.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">East of Richards we
        entered Sam Houston National Forest, and I was once again
        struck by the familiar landscape. This time we were
        riding through the piney North Woods, along deserted
        straight roads paved with squished deer. There was even a
        lakey-smelling lake with bass fishermen and wading
        herons. The whole experience &#150;all of my senses
        carrying me back to some imagined pastoral scene from my
        childhood&#151;made me forget that we were still in
        Texas.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">After lunch in New Waverly
        &#150;where Fred ate a slice of pie bigger than his
        head&#151;the paradigm of the South firmly took root once
        and for all. While we were still in the National Forest,
        it was heavily populated, mostly by African Americans.
        Cars and abandoned appliances littered the yards; empty
        cans of Malt Liquor filled the ditches. I was thrilled to
        cross the first streamlike substance billed as a
        &quot;bayou&quot;, yet somewhat less excited by the road,
        which carried scary high-speed traffic and had no
        shoulder. It was a relief to arrive in Coldspring, where
        we were to dine with Fred&#146;s hilarious Aunt Anita
        from Houston. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Anita and her cousin Laura
        arrived shortly after we did, and they were lots of fun.
        When we offered them cocktails (we&#146;re now carrying a
        flask of scotch with us on the road for the sorer days
        which terminate in dry towns), Anita said she preferred
        vodka, and proceeded to pull a bottle out of her bag,
        along with cups and ice cubes. I asked her if she had
        been a girl scout. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The two women had grown up
        in Louisiana and gave us tips on where to stop on our
        upcoming journey. We all had dinner in a triple-wide
        trailer/restaurant. I had promised Fred that I&#146;d eat
        a chicken fried steak before leaving Texas, and realized
        my opportunities were numbered. I regretted my choice as
        soon as it arrived, however, since what sat gooily upon
        my plate was one of the nastiest food items I&#146;ve
        ever ingested. When Anita asked us if we&#146;d be eating
        dessert, I thought I&#146;d puke. She urged us to stick
        around for a few days and stay at her lake house nearby,
        which sounded mighty tempting. But I had just committed
        to meeting my brother two days later in DeRidder,
        Louisiana. And after over a thousand miles of Texas,
        I&#146;m kinda ready to be in another state.</font></p>

        to Silsbee, 76 Miles</b></font><p><font size="2" face="Arial">I can&#146;t believe that we are still in
        Texas. We&#146;ve been riding here for over a thousand
        miles and we are both ready for a new state, but it
        won&#146;t come today. The last days have been more
        ordeal-like than idyllic, cold, headwinds and my aching
        knee torturing me. At breakfast things began to turn
        around.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Our waitress was charming,
        the breakfast scrumptious and the weather beautiful.
        People in the diner asked us about our trip. This was the
        Texas I had come to love before Austin. Along the way we
        mentioned to someone that we liked this part of Texas and
        the part before Austin but not around Austin. &quot;That
        figures&quot; she snapped back, &quot;no one there is
        from Texas, they&#146;re all rude.&quot;</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">After breakfast we rode
        through the &quot;Big Thicket.&quot; The first time Andy
        told me that was the name of the area I misheard him, I
        thought he had said the &quot;Big Brisket.&quot;
        Couldn&#146;t imagine why they&#146;d name a forest after
        a cut of beef, but this is Texas.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The Thicket was big, we
        rode through it most of the day and the brush and trees
        shaded us from the strong cross winds that blew
        throughout the day. The sun beamed down on us, Andy even
        took off his shirt in a futile attempt to even out his
        tan. Before we knew it we&#146;d knocked down over 40
        miles and arrived in a highway junction/town called, of
        all things, Thicket. The whole route was dotted with
        general stores like the ones we lunched in. The most
        interesting one was after lunch in a place known as Honey
        Landing.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">They&#146;d seen a lot of
        cyclists there and were ready to offer advice. First, the
        route that the map proposed was preposterous; it would
        take us miles out of our way. They suggested that we take
        a different road that would shave off 19 or 20 miles,
        which was hard to fathom because our map predicted 20
        miles until Silsbee. Andrew and I both contemplated
        stealing a stuffed armadillo that was on the shelf at the
        store. Instead we posed for photos with it. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">We opted to skip the
        shortcut and steamed into Silsbee. A quick stop at a
        Dollar Store yielded one of my first
        up-close-and-personal white trash experiences. I watched
        a drunken b**** berate the African-American clerk for
        supposedly overcharging her on some item. After doing our
        laundry we dressed and went for dinner to a steak buffet.
        The waiters were careful to keep their distance as we ate
        for fear they might lose an appendage in the fray. We
        waddled back to our Motel, updated the website and
        crashed.</font></p>

        to DeRidder, LA, 78 miles</b></font><p><font size="2" face="Arial">We have made it out of the Lone Star State
        alive &#150; just barely.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Fred and I had decided
        last night that we&#146;d stray from the prescribed route
        in order to shave off some miles and get our butts to
        Louisiana as quickly as possible. It meant riding on some
        busier roads, but at least those had shoulders. The worst
        part of the day by far was on the quietest road, where
        the traffic was deadly. The numerous logging trucks were
        bad, but the pickups were worse. Every backwoods redneck
        cracker hillbilly rube seemed intent on running us off of
        the shoulderless road between Kirbyville and Bon Wier. In
        spite of this constant human menace, our real adversary
        was the wind again, however. We&#146;ve been fighting it
        all the way from Blanco, before Austin, but today it was
        blowing particularly stiffly. I fantasized about a bike
        trip where my daily destination would be a function of
        which way the wind was blowing &#150;definitely something
        to be tried some day. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The notable events of the
        day were these: I endured yet another flat tire between
        Evadale and Buna; In Bon Wier we stopped long enough to
        eavesdrop on a conversation between a group of
        adolescents in which the only word I understood was
        &quot;possum&quot;; This evening in DeRidder we went in
        search of Cajun cuisine and stumbled upon a charming
        establishment called &quot;Taco Bell. Seated near us was
        a big group of dudes in coveralls speaking&#133;French!
        Were they Cajuns? No, they said, they were from Quebec
        and worked in the paper mill; Brother Marty knocked on
        the door of our hotel only minutes after I left a message
        on his answering machine. He drove all the way from
        Minneapolis in less than two days to join us, and he
        seems to have a lot more energy than we do. We&#146;ve
        already informed him that tomorrow will be a low-mileage
        day&#133;</font></p>

        Guest Rider/Writer - Marty Broan-Andy&#146;s brother</b></font><p><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;Goin&#146; down the road,
        feelin&#146; bad,<br>
        Goin&#146; where the climate suits my clothes,<br>
        Goin&#146; where the water tastes like wine,<br>
        Don&#146;t wanna be treated this away&quot; - <i>Elizabeth
        Cotten</i></font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">My car stereo cranked this
        road-trip anthem while crossing into Louisiana from the
        Ozarks, home of the Whitewater scandal and, it quickly
        became apparent, more than a few Deliverance-esque inbred
        roadside gawkers. The scenery slowly morphed from
        snow-stained bleakscape in Iowa to full-fledged summer in
        Louisiana. After an abnormally long winter in Minnesota,
        that song felt pretty true to me&#151;every part except
        for the water tasting like wine, of course.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Andy and Fred called me
        two days ago and said I should meet them in De Ridder,
        their first town in Louisiana. As soon as I crossed into
        De Ridder, I checked my voice mail for A+F and found that
        they had just arrived to the Best Western directly across
        the street from the pay phone. Fortuitous! They appeared
        nearly comatose and Taco-Bell stupefied, having
        experienced yet another longer-than-expected day, only to
        be greeted by the character-less town of De Ridder. What
        they needed was an injection of energy, fresh legs and
        enthusiasm&#151;neither of which I was able to muster
        after 17+ hours of driving. I was definitely feeling
        not-so-fresh.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The festivities began,
        nonetheless, and I was humored that I won the bike naming
        contest. The names that I picked for them were Siegfried
        and Roy, the scary Vegas tiger-taming couple that A+F
        appear to emulate. I suppose I had an unfair advantage in
        the contest, knowing their special affinity for the
        over-tanned Deutsch robots. The promised Texas treats
        were a Tex-ass flag bandana and some odd roadside
        booty&#151;a home made beauty parlor sign that uses bad
        clip art as samples of their work. We then drained the
        last of Fred&#146;s scotch stash (De Ridder is in the
        middle of Louisiana&#146;s only dry parish) and quickly
        passed out in front of the comforting glow of late-night
        TV.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The next morning, we
        mistakenly wandered into the world&#146;s largest
        Wal-Mart to find some supplies&#151;q-tips, bear mace for
        aggressive dogs, an air horn and A+F&#146;s new favorite
        candy, Reese&#146;s cookie cups. We narrowly escaped
        before succumbing to anxiety attacks.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">On our way out of De
        Ridder, everyone was distantly nice - like they really
        think you&#146;re satanic freaks from the North (which we
        may be) but still treat you like God&#146;s children
        because they will go to hell if they say anything bad
        about you. Under each smile are some firmly clenched
        teeth. Nice is still better than mean -- cars here stop
        politely for you to cut across three lanes of traffic,
        give you a remarkably wide berth, and honk only to be
        friendly (Andy&#146;s still not convinced it is friendly
        and sneers with every passing horn. He now gleefully
        responds to honkers with his new Wal-Mart air horn, which
        is more anemic than we had hoped).</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">First stop - Hilltop
        Groceries, a half-full store with a 101 Dalmations
        snow-globe collection in the window, courtesy of several
        McDonald&#146;s happy meals. I bought a coke in one of
        those little 8 oz. bottles and the lady at the register
        somehow chose the topic of how Coke made in Mexico often
        has &quot;fingers-&#145;n-shit&quot; in it. She said a
        friend of hers found a thumb in a V-8 and was paid off by
        their PR execs in a couple bucks worth of coupons. I
        think she actually WANTS to be one of the lucky ones some
        day, like Charlie and the golden ticket in Willy Wonka. I
        pray my Coke is American and find additional comfort in
        my clear glass bottle.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">During our next stop, a
        bus-load of high school girl athletes drives into the gas
        station and throw some racy remarks like &quot;wooooo!
        Bend over!&quot; It confirms my suspicion that we&#146;re
        out of the hard-core Christian parish&#133;</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The amount of roadkill
        along these rolling roads is startling. I can&#146;t help
        but think of a hot new enterprise down here&#151;roadkill
        welcome mats. They would be very simple to make since
        they already are quite flat, and the armor on the
        armadillos is especially well-suited for scraping mud off
        of shoes. Supply certainly wouldn&#146;t be a problem
        since these surprisingly thick pine forests toss copious
        amounts of dillos, possums, skunks, nutria and coons into
        the asphalt altar to pick-up trucks.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">We make it to Oberlin for
        lunch, already an infinitely more interesting town than
        DeRidder. After riding down the main strip (which is
        truly a rockin&#146; two block showcase for the high
        school students to zip down in their pick-em-up trucks),
        we find our only two choices for dining are a pizza joint
        and a crawfish/catfish place. Every town has to have at
        least two restaurants&#151;one for the blacks and one for
        the whites. &quot;We don&#146;t mean nuthin&#146; of
        it,&quot; the &#145;non-racist&#146; whites say. The
        catfish is tasty, if not way greasy and the only
        adornment in the place is a photo of Shaquille
        O&#146;Neal with the owner.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The last 20 miles on to
        Mamou are flat in the extreme. Along the road are
        sculpted pools of dirty water--breeding grounds for
        jillions of crawfish. They look like rice patties, but
        this is definitely not Bali. We are entering the heart of
        Cajun country. Even in the flats, welcome mats abound.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">There was a particularly
        nasty dog gauntlet in the last few miles. People down
        here love their dogs mean and nasty (like those scary
        Rottweilers in the &quot;The Omen&quot;), but usually
        caged. Several houses in row seemed to agree to set their
        dogs free on us simultaneously. We had a slight collision
        while frantically readjusting to battle formation. Fear
        not, though. I travel with two well-armed cyclists who
        expertly crippled two dogs with pepper spray. Immensely
        satisfying.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The ride down main street
        tells us accommodations will be scarce and primitive. We
        ultimately end up at a &quot;tragic pit&quot; called the
        Bamboo Inn &#150; a double-sized trailer next to a
        mosquito breeding pond. After some authentic cajun food
        (shrimp etoufee on catfish and gumbo), we went to a
        couple of Mamou&#146;s many bars. The Cazan Bar and Hotel
        is decrepit but filled with turn-of-the-century
        character. Our first encounter is with Sue&#151;an
        overzealous, horny forty-something with no front teeth
        and a skimpy cowgirl outfit, packing more than its share
        of cottage cheese. In Andy and Fred code, she offers us
        TMI (too much information). Her first husband is a
        lieutenant for the prison nearby and proudly cornered 3
        escaped convicts and shot them to death. She says
        she&#146;s single now but the folks around her say
        otherwise. In fact, they roll their eyes in her presence,
        saying she&#146;s always out for fresh meat. It&#146;s
        not hard to tell that she&#146;s trouble. Gayle, the
        bartender, is clad in a skimpy leather vest and tells us
        which places to avoid (basically the one black bar).</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The Casanova Bar across
        the street is truly the heart of Cajun culture. We
        quickly meet Tante Sue - wife of Fred, as in the famous
        Fred&#146;s Lounge. The rowdy French-speaking
        octogenarian sat us down and instantly made us feel at
        ease. She is a total hoot. If you are within 100 miles,
        make that 1000, you must seek her out. Scary Sue from
        across the street followed us in to the Casanova to talk
        to me (I guess she smelled my hetero blood) and her
        intentions are clear. I try not to reveal my nausea when
        she places a Playboy bunny sticker between her boobs and
        coyly looks at me. Meanwhile, A+F share some chuckles
        with a couple of older lesbian Cajuns. A brutally honest
        harmless redneck kept asking Andy and Fred, &quot;So why
        the hell are you DOING this trip?&quot; I encourage him,
        since I, too, would like to know their motivation.
        I&#146;m just not as persistent. A dozen or so older
        Cajuns are in the back room playing poker and the French
        card game of La Boule. This place should be preserved for
        the ages, as it embodies such sincere hospitality and a
        culture fighting the black hole of Wal-Marts and MTV.
        Somehow they preserve it here, with weekly performances
        of true Cajun music and free use of their odd patois. One
        bitter pill to swallow with the culture is an
        undercurrent of racism. For instance&#151;I told Tante
        Sue how much I enjoy Cajun music and Zydeco, and she
        frowned and quickly retorted, &quot;but that Zydeco
        isn&#146;t ours, it&#146;s the black people&#146;s.
        It&#146;s much different.&quot; I suppose the addition of
        a washboard makes all the difference in the world between
        blacks and whites down here.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">During our long walk back
        to our trailer, we see three cops pull over a young
        wasted driver, who unwisely gets out of the car and
        staggers toward the cop car. The cops see us stop to
        watch and emphatically tell us to keep walking. If
        there&#146;s one thing I know NOT to do in Louisiana,
        it&#146;s not to challenge an angry cop. The drunken
        idiot&#146;s fate appears certain&#151;get the shit
        kicked out of him by some rabid troopers and sleep
        face-down on the floor of the local jail. Our
        &quot;hotel&quot; room is adjacent to some obliterated
        nedrecks who seem to be only capable of saying
        &quot;fuckin&#146;&quot; and &quot;fix my truck.&quot;
        They friskily bounce off the walls (ours) until we attain
        some unsettled state of sleep. </font></p>

        <td><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>19 April, Mamou to St.
        Francisville, 80 miles</b></font><p><font size="2" face="Arial">Strangely configured day, sort of like a
        meal where you eat dessert before the appetizers. Woke up
        early to the revelry of our neighbor arriving home from
        the previous nights party. They were hooting, hollering,
        banging on the walls, playing music from their pickup and
        generally rollicking. We loaded up our bikes and headed
        back downtown for breakfast.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Across the street from
        Fred&#146;s lounge we dined. At 8 am people started to
        roll into the bar. We first learned about Fred&#146;s
        from my aunt when we met her for dinner a few nights
        before. It opens one day per week for five hours from 8am
        to 1:30pm pretty unbelievable that a business can operate
        this way. A live Cajun band plays, people drink and
        dance. We had the good fortune to meet the gracious wife
        (Tante Sue) of the now deceased proprietor of Fred&#146;s
        and her friend Lynn the night before.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">After breakfast we
        strolled across the boulevard and walked into another
        world. As the door opened we were hit by a wind of smoke
        and blaring Cajun tunage. Lynn and Tante Sue had reserved
        a place at the bar for us and before we could say
        &quot;Stoly&quot; we each were endowed with a bloody Mary
        and were swaying to the music. When Fred&#146;s is open
        they broadcast the music live on a local radio station.
        The announcer was hilarious, a huge Cajun dude rattling
        his spiel in French peppering it with words like
        &quot;vacuum&quot; and other americanisms. Before we knew
        it, it was time to leave. As we said goodbye Tante Sue
        insisted that we stay so she could sing us another song.
        She dedicated &quot;If I had five days left to live
        I&#146;d give up three to die in your arms&quot; to us
        and I nearly cried. At nearly eighty (she has great grand
        children) she lives the fullest life you can imagine, and
        somehow we had won her heart.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;IHNE&quot; was the
        first thing out of my mouth when we got on our bikes,
        usually a drink is the last thing we&#146;d do on any
        given day, today we began with it. My system was out of
        synch and we had been on bikes for six days without a
        break. We originally opted to ride only about twenty
        miles, but the conditions were too favorable to make it
        that short. Besides, Andy and Marty had worked out a
        shortcut that would eliminate 30 or forty miles from our
        day. As we rode out of town we stopped for water and
        discovered that there were two new responses from folks
        when they found out about where we were going and for how
        long. African Americans usually said &quot;y&#146;all
        crazy&quot; or made some gesture that translated into the
        same. The Caucasian populous usually asked us why, the
        less inventive ones &quot;how y&#146;all payin&#146; for
        this?&quot;</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Today marked our first
        riding incident. Andy took a solo spill from his bike at
        cruising speed. No great damage, just a little red badge
        of courage in the form of some road rash. The shoulder
        was very badly paved and he caught his front tire in a
        crack, stopping the bike short and flinging Andy and Roy
        (his bike&#146;s new name!) to the ground. Luckily he
        landed out of harm&#146;s way and was back on his trusty
        steed within a few moments of falling. (donations for
        Andy&#146;s band-aid and anti-bacterial cream can be sent
        care of &#133;. ) All kidding aside, we are more than
        thankful for how uneventful the trip has been in this
        regard. The biggest casualty of the fall was the Virgin
        that adorned Andy&#146;s handlebar bag. We hope that we
        can restore the Virgin of Humpty again.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Our dreams of a shortcut
        evaporated when we discovered that the ferry across the
        Mississippi we intended to take no longer operated nor
        was the road on the other side of the river passable. We
        improvised and took a road toward Baton Rouge. That plan
        didn&#146;t work. The hotel we intended to rest at was
        full, so it looked like we&#146;d have to ride another 25
        miles towards the city, re-route back towards St.
        Francisville or camp. Option &quot;D&quot; made itself
        available: a sweet older woman offered us a ride north to
        New Roads just across the river from St. Francisville.
        This would get us to the ferry before it closed and
        across ol&#146; Miss before sunset.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">St. Francisville surprised
        us. Gloria had painted a picture of a poor and retched
        backwater, but we discovered a rich little suburb with
        more lawyers per capita than southern California. We
        tried to stay at cutesy little B&amp;B&#146;s with no
        luck; everything was full. Settled in at the very generic
        60&#146;s inn at the edge of town on the highway. Dinner
        was at the hotel restaurant as Eagles tunes as covered by
        the lounge act in the bar trickled in. </font></p>
