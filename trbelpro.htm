        <td><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>Prologue - Getting
        there</b></font><p><font size="2" face="Arial">Andy&#146;s
        mom facilitated the Belize, Mexico and Cuba trial trip by
        inviting us along for a winter vacation as she has done
        ever since I met Andrew. Joyce is generous and super to
        be around. This time she outdid herself, choosing
        International Expeditions&#146; trip to Belize. Andy and
        I are still more than curious as to why the travel and
        logistics folks at IE chose to put us on the red-eye to
        Houston because it included a five hour layover in the
        beautiful and elegant Houston Airport.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">We managed drunkenly to
        get on the flight after a little going away party &#150;
        no thanks to the dizzy clerk who began to check us in. It
        was only by chance (OK - a little flirting never hurt
        anyone&#133;) that the manager intervened, rescuing us
        from a sentence of center seats for four hours. Upon
        arrival in Houston we used our imagination to find ways
        to amuse ourselves. First we rode the
        &quot;ultra-modern&quot; inter-terminal transportation
        system to the Airport Marriott for a little breakfast.
        Then struggling to find some way to pass the time we
        dressed-up the hotel&#146;s XMAS display with our bicycle
        helmets, and finally sinking into the big wingback chairs
        in their lobby for a little shuteye.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>Belize City</b></font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Arrived in Belize where
        our bicycles were (as usual) the center of attention.
        Just once, it would be nice to be more interesting than
        my ride. &quot;How much do they weigh?&quot; &quot;How
        much did they cost?&quot; seemed to be the greeting we
        heard most from worker types in the airport and
        elsewhere.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Belize City is not much to
        look at, just another underdeveloped Caribbean town,
        thankfully we were not to spend too much time there.
        Funny how much wildlife there was even in town. During
        our (to be daily) morning birdwalk we saw everything from
        macaws to parrots. Here, our fearless tour leader Martin
        demonstrated his extraordinary knowledge of animal and
        plant life for the first time. I thought it was a fluke
        at first, but consistently he was able to identify the
        common and latin names of everything living in Belize.
        Not only could he I.D them but he also often had an
        amusing story about his kids had captured, tortured,
        molested or donated one to a zoo or botanical garden.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The cast of characters on
        our tour of Belize was just a little bit older than us.
        All of our compatriots called us &quot;the boys&quot;
        (Andrew is 33 and I am 34). Near the end of our trip one
        of our fellow travelers celebrated his 88<sup>th</sup>
        birthday. Not that we are ageists, but we were a little
        worried. Our fears were quickly calmed. Nearly everyone
        was an intrepid traveler and easy to get along with. Bob
        and Diane were amazing, Diane had prepared months for
        this journey. She and Bob always had the right outfit,
        equipment, salve, medication and tool for every
        situation. Diane had a database of items they had packed
        cross-referencing it to which bag it was packed in.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">There were a few
        exceptions; some of our fellow travelers were not quite
        as stalwart as the others. Our welcome dinner was held in
        the &quot;best restaurant in Belize&quot; conveniently
        located but a hundred yards from the hotel. One of our
        party actually took a cab from the dinner back to our
        domicile because she had heard that Belize City was too
        dangerous.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>Around Belize City</b></font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Our first day of adventure
        began with a boat ride through the wetlands north of
        Belize City. We spent nearly 2.5 hours in the sun looking
        at every type of Heron you can imagine. The stars of the
        day were the Jicana and the Purple speckled
        &quot;Idunnowhat&quot; (I am not a birder, and Martin is
        probably very disappointed that his knowledge was lost on
        me). At lunch we ate and Andy did his best to feed the
        local fire ants who dined on his foot while we downed our
        delicious home-cooked picnic of chicken beans and rice.
        Luckily his allergy to fire ants did not kick in and we
        did not have to rush him to a hospital.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">After birds, it was on to
        the monkeys. Howler monkeys remain true to their name
        especially when taunted by idiots on the ground. The
        British army was conducting training exercises in the
        monkey reserve, their cadets running a course through the
        jungle. When they reached us and saw us looking up into
        the canopy and started screaming up at them demonstrating
        that they were clearly more intelligent than their simian
        counterparts. The monkeys were very spirited and have
        become accustomed to humans since they live in a
        protected area. More rambunctious and larger than the
        monkeys were the mosquitoes whose bites we were quickly
        becoming accustomed to. </font></p>

        </td>
        <td><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>The highlands</b></font><p><font size="2" face="Arial">A wickedly rough bus ride was to
        take us to the Belizian Highlands, on the way up we saw
        palms and tropical vegetation give way to pines and
        brush. The ride lulled me to sleep as Martin bitched
        about how terrible the Ford busses that IE purchases. As
        if to reward his outward disdain both the bus's u-joints
        failed making a loud popping noise. Andy and I had rented
        bicycles for the day and put them on the bus, with the
        intent to ride back to our hotel near San Ignacio. As our
        fearless driver Herman ripped apart the bus (took about
        five minutes) finding the offending parts, we ate lunch
        and prepared to ride back into town to get help.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Visions of rescuing our
        fellow travelers danced in our heads. We imagined that we
        would be the valiant saviors of our stranded party riding
        off into the sunset on our trusty steeds fetching help
        for the crew of our expedition. All of this faded quickly
        when Herman pulled out his radio and had ordered the
        parts for the bus and alternative transportation to pick
        up the others while he fixed the bus. Still, we got on
        our bikes and rode down the hill. I anticipated that the
        ride would be at least a little less bumpy on bike,
        especially since our fancy rentals had suspension, but I
        was wrong. In fact after 10 miles on the road, it was
        Andrew who needed rescuing. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">He had forgotten his
        gloves and began complaining bitterly about the blisters
        that were torturing his hands. I loaned him my gloves and
        then discovered how really rough the road was. Within a
        few miles I couldn&#146;t feel my hands for the
        vibration. To add to the fun, the beautiful day gave way
        to storm clouds and the sky opened up on us. The road
        quickly transformed from a bumpy dirt road to one big mud
        puddle. Now it was not only bumpy but treacherous. As we
        made our way down the road we saw the Chevy Suburbans
        going to pick up our fellow tourers. We still beat the
        rest of the group back to our jungly hotel, but we were a
        little worse for wear. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Joyce had a funny
        &quot;encounter&quot; that night at our hotel (actually a
        collection of bungalows in the middle of the jungle). The
        water heater in her unit was not functioning so she came
        to the bar to find us to help her. We were all a little
        surprised that the barman volunteered to help her with it
        instead of calling the front desk. He left the bar
        unattended and went to her room. At the room he helped
        her light the water heater. Afterwards he asked
        &quot;where is your husband?&quot; After hearing she had
        none, &quot;where is your boyfriend?&quot; Again, none so
        &#150; &quot;ever tried younger guys?&quot; Finally the
        &#145;closer&#146; - &quot;I could scrub your
        back&#133;?&quot; Joyce politely declined, not fancying
        the rasta youngster.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>The Road to Guatemala
        and Tikal</b></font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">On the way to ruins of the
        Mayan civilization, Tikal, we learned the depths of the
        stupidity of a few of our fellow travelers. At least I
        did. First a little about the voyage there. We buzzed
        down to the border, stopping first at a little but
        impressive ruin at Xunantanich. To get there we had to
        cross a river on a ferry that was hand powered by a guy
        turning a wench. Once at the border Joyce and Andy did a
        little shopping. Joyce bought the rum and Andy the coke.
        Joyce needed to drown out the droning voice of one of our
        fellow travelers who could not stand a moment of silence.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Once in Guatemala IE hired
        armed escorts for the bus because there had been
        robberies perpetrated against tour busses recently
        despite the cessation of aggression in the ongoing war
        there. As soon as we left Belize the road deteriorated
        rapidly. It became a massively potholed dirt affair that
        threatened to break another u-joint. So bumpy was the
        road, it was necessary for us to trade seats halfway
        through the journey to give the jostled bones of those
        riding over the wheels a break. We finally reached paved
        road after two-and-one-half hours. We stopped at a
        tourist trap and here is where I learned of the idiocy of
        one of our to-be-un-named travelers. She asked me to help
        her negotiate a &#145;good&#146; price for her on an
        exceedingly ugly mask though the shopkeeper spoke perfect
        English. Then after the guy quoted her a price in
        Quetzales she assumed it was dollars and immediately
        agreed to it (I think there were eight or so Quetzales to
        the Belizian Dollar which is exactly equal to an American
        Dollar). I still don&#146;t understand why she asked me
        to bear witness to this escapade.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Tikal is extraordinary.
        It's no wonder the Mayans chose this as a population
        center. Sitting by the pool watching the clouds blanket
        the sky and our laundry dry, I could hardly hear myself
        think over the screeching of all of the birds. This is
        the jungle with a capital &quot;j&quot;. Our first full
        day in Tikal was spent exploring the park with Martin and
        our stinky but well-informed guide, Foster. We wandered
        through the ruins observing the juicy jungle, trying to
        dominate the temples and other structures the way the
        Tikalese dominated all the local mayan outposts. The
        folks in Tikal were a fickle lot, building two-temple
        complexes that were used for but twenty years and then
        abandoned. About 15% of the local civilization lived
        within the area of the archeological zone (about 6 sq.
        miles) with the remainder of the 150K (in its heyday)
        living outside the splendor of the central city. This was
        a big civilization, Foster stated that within a 20 mile
        radius of Tikal there are the ruins of twenty cities of
        equal size. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">As the civilization
        matured it became more and more violent. Their ritual
        ball games changed from rewarding the winning team with a
        one-way ticket to the afterlife to murdering the losing
        team. Occasional ritual slaughter of captives from the
        enemies armies was supplanted by ritual offerings of
        children and virgins. Andrew wanted to make captive of
        the cute hotel employee that was acting as a porter for
        one of the older folks in our group. It took the best
        part of two days to see the most significant ruins of
        Tikal. To see all of them it would take a few days
        longer. This is the most extensive ruin we saw on the
        trip, and well worth a trip back.</font></p>

    <tr>
        <td><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>A night in the Jungle
        and the Zoo</b></font><p><font size="2" face="Arial">On
        the way back to Belize City and on to the Keys for a few
        days of sunning and snorkling, we stopped at Pook's Hill
        Jungle Resort. It was a magical and mysterious place from
        the start. First, it was very far off the main highway
        tucked back in the jungle with no other structures or
        civilization close to it. It was the first time IE had
        booked the resort and neither the guide nor driver had
        been there or knew what to expect. This became obvious as
        the road to the hotel became narrower and narrower, with
        the jungle encroaching on all sides and above. There were
        more than a few places where the bus nearly was pinned in
        by the jungle. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Earlier in the trip we had
        initiated a practice of declaring the &quot;word of the
        day&quot;, whoever says the word would receive a sharp
        pinch. The first and most memorable word du jour was
        &quot;agouti&quot; (which is a furry oversized gerbil and
        takes on meaning of its own in later chapters). Each of
        the bungalows had a name as well as a number and
        coincidentally as we were helping Joyce with her bags to
        her room we jokingly asked our host where the
        &quot;agouti&quot; room was, not knowing if there was
        one. She pointed in the direction we were walking and we
        just assumed she had misheard us. When we reached
        Joyce&#146;s room it was the Agouti Room.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">We arrived just before
        nightfall with just enough daylight to have a tour of the
        iguana farm that our host&#146;s daughter had founded as
        a science project. Seems that the locals have taken a
        liking to the eggs of iguanas and this practice is
        threatening the population. She breeds them and releases
        them into the wild to balance things out. The ambiance at
        Pook's Hill was amazing; the owners cleared only enough
        jungle for the cabins and the main house, which are
        perched above a steep ravine hiding a roaring river. As
        night fell, lightning bugs illuminated the grass and
        jungle, creating the effect of natural Christmas lights.
        After dinner, as the bugs' iridescent glow faded, the
        stars took over. If there were stars and lights outside
        there were fireworks inside. One of our group consumed an
        entire year&#146;s worth of alcohol before dinner and was
        a little looped. Before she stopped making sense
        entirely, she nicknamed the two really stupid members of
        our party &quot;Dumb and Dumber&quot;.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The next day we spent the
        morning at the zoo. By this time Andrew and I had had
        enough of the tour and walked around on our own,
        apparently missing Martin petting half the animals and
        explaining how his son had contributed half of them to
        the park. The cats were amazing. Most striking was the
        ocelot, who purred and rubbed his plush coat against the
        fence, seemingly begging to be pet. Maybe next time.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>Hamburger Key</b></font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Ambergris Key was a great
        place to hang out and rest after our rigorous tour of
        Belize and Guatemala, except at night when the largest
        and most vicious skeeters that ever sucked blood came to
        haunt. One of the folks on the tour held a lottery to
        guess how many bites she had on her legs (165). We swam,
        snorkeled, ran, rode bikes around the island and enjoyed
        being free of busses and planned activity. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">I committed the biggest
        faux-pas of the trip one night, losing one of the dice
        from Joyce&#146;s backgammon set. For this I&#146;ll
        likely never again be invited on a vacation with Joyce
        (wah!).</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">On our last night I almost
        cried. We had had a such great time; even the most
        ridiculous situations had been really fun and wonderful.
        Martin gave his departure speech at the dinner table in
        our hotel&#146;s restaurant and explained the logistics
        of the next day&#146;s flights off the island. His
        parting remarks were most incongruous, unusual and
        hilarious. In the presence of the full dining room where
        other parties were sharing tender romantic moments over
        wine in this tropical paradise Martin chose to warn us
        about botflies in a booming voice. Botflies attach
        themselves to mosquitoes and as the skeeter bites, the
        little critter lays an egg in the wound, Martin
        explained, &quot;You will know it is not just a mosquito
        bite, because it won&#146;t heal and it will continue to
        itch every three hours or so when the botfly feeds.&quot;
        If this wasn&#146;t enough, he began to tell us in great
        detail how to suffocate the little passenger and then
        squeeze him out. By this time, everyone in the dining
        room had stopped eating and was imagining how many
        botflies were inhabiting their 165 mosquito bites.</font></p>
