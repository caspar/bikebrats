        Copenhagen</b></font><p><font size="2" face="Arial">First
        of all this section is dedicated to Niels Kaae. Without
        his seemingly infinite generosity and patience I would
        not have recovered so quickly from my shoulder injury.
        When I first explained to him that I didn&#146;t think
        I&#146;d be able to ride for 2-4 weeks and that there was
        a possibility I&#146;d have to have surgery that would
        involve eight weeks of convalescence he told me
        unequivocally that I &quot;could stay as long as I
        like.&quot;</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">I learned to love
        Copenhagen which Niels dubbed the &quot;Italy of Northern
        Europe.&quot; This phrase fits it well. People are
        relaxed, but the streets are immaculate. There is not
        much left of the city that was discovered in the
        1100&#146;s. Seems that Copenhagenites are not very good
        with fire and much of the city has burned at one time or
        another. My favorite story is that of St. Nicholas
        Church. When the belfry caught fire one night the keeper
        of the church was off drinking so the fire department had
        to watch it burn, the tower fell and burned the whole
        neighborhood. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">My first night there a
        dude named Morden took me on a city tour. I saw the city
        and learned of the zillion fires that devastated
        Copenhagen. I spent most days walking around, exploring,
        meeting people, and seeing the museums of this rich
        northern capital. One striking characteristic of the
        Danish is that they can conjugate the verb &quot;to
        party.&quot; In fact many drink so much that they can
        hardly stand. When they stagger into you in a bar you
        find yourself praying that they won&#146;t spontaneously
        barf on you. The Danish claim that most of these folks
        are Swedes who have staggered down from their country for
        a drink in order to avoid the stiff taxes up there. That
        story accounts for some of the drunken behavior, but not
        all of it.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The Danes are enamored
        with the bicycle as a form of transportation. This
        immediately endeared them to me. Many Danes have more
        than one bike and they dash about town on them. The
        Danish have very different bikes then, say, for example
        the Dutch. Dutch bikes are big, heavy, black beasts with
        great fenders. You ride a Dutch bike sitting up straight
        and tall and saunter to your destination. Danish bikes
        are city-racing hybrids with bare frames and chains,
        little flimsy looking fenders and utilitarian handlebars.
        Danes lean over their handlebars and zip from
        place-to-place with great haste on their highly tuned
        cycles.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Copenhagen is a
        middle-sized city with a very dramatic skyline. Spires on
        top of churches and official buildings punctuate the sky.
        From my window in my sleeping loft I could see a few of
        them in the night sky. One had a massive clock that
        served as my &quot;horloge&quot; and alarm clock. Each
        day it would wake me with its first bell at eight a.m.
        Another feature of the night sky were the fireworks that
        lit the rooftops three days a week just before midnight.
        They were launched from the amusement park a few blocks
        away. Tivoli is like a museum of amusement parks. It
        retains a feeling of before the turn of the century.
        Couples stroll around the little lake and gardens, dudes
        try to win prizes for their dates and take them on scary
        rides to get them to hold them. While in Copenhagen I had
        an amazing little social life, part of which is recorded
        on the Denmark Social Whirlwind page.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">I&#146;ll miss Copenhagen,
        Niels, and the great times I had there. Denmark will
        always occupy a special place in my heart. I felt a tear
        well in my eye as I said good-bye to it and Niels on our
        departure to Sweden.</font></p>

        <td><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>31 July,
        Copenhagen/Malmo to Horby, Sweden, 74k</b></font><p><font size="2" face="Arial">Leaving Copenhagen we grabbed a
        snack for the ferry. A smoked salmon, dill and lemon
        sandwich to munch on the boat. The ride to Malmo went
        very fast. It took but 45 minutes to make it across.
        Seemed funny to go through passport control as it
        didn&#146;t feel like we had even left Denmark. Sweden
        looked just a little cleaner and there were far fewer
        cyclists. Strange because the Swedes seem to promote
        bicycles just as much as the Danes. Every destination
        could be reached by a bike path.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">We made it to the
        countryside very quickly and then to a cute little town
        called Lund. Lund&#146;s suburbs were far less
        interesting then central Lund. At first I felt like we
        had entered a Socialist Twilight Zone. Modern brick
        buildings, identical architecture and no one on the
        street. Soon this cold and off-putting atmosphere gave
        way to a more traditional European town. We found the
        central plaza and a hipster café to stop at and have a
        little snack. We opted for a traditional Swedish
        Quesadilla. It came with the most disgusting looking
        gaucamole you have ever seen. It was more a mix of
        avocado and hummous than gaucamole. We were struck by the
        fact that no one seemed to think that we were foreigners
        (hard to believe) and everyone tried to speak with us in
        Swedish. Swedish almost sounds a little like English if
        you&#146;ve drank too much. We&#146;ll find ourselves
        fooled into thinking we actually understand it now and
        then.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Over an hour later we
        found ourselves in a teeny-weeny little town. We stopped
        at a market to buy water and a snack. After we finished
        the water I went back into the store with the intent of
        throwing away the bottle only to find that there was a
        massive deposit on the bottle and got nearly the price of
        the drink back. After this revelation the sky turned
        black and began to dump rain. We made it as far as the
        next bit of shelter in town, near a supermarket. Dashed
        in to look for a salty snack. We bought a loaf of bread
        and a toothpaste tube full of fish eggs and chowed. Once
        the rain passed we chased the storm down the road riding
        through the puddles it had just left. We stopped to ask
        directions to the youth hostel and I encountered the
        first person in Sweden who did not greet us with an
        ear-to-ear smile. He didn&#146;t speak English and seemed
        vaguely offended that I had no command of Swedish.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">When we finally reached
        our intended destination we found the tourist office
        closed. Ulla and Nele were across from it in a bus
        enclosure ringing their bike bells when they noticed our
        frustration. They were traveling for two weeks and were
        just about ready to head home. They shared their maps
        with us and helped us find the youth hostel just outside
        of town. &quot;Youth&quot; is perhaps not the right word
        to use. We were absolutely the youngest guests by some
        twenty years by all accounts. Even the septuagenarian
        desk clerk seemed to wonder why we were staying there
        given our youth. &quot;Cheap&quot; is not the operative
        word when it comes to youth hostels. Ours cost us $50
        bucks, had no shower in the room and did not include the
        paper sheets we had to buy for the beds. In every other
        way the place was great and absolutely spotless. One
        surprise was the fact that there were no towels in the
        room, but there were beautiful, fluffy and white terry
        bathrobes for each of us that made great towels. We
        munched the final bits of our roe on bread and retired.</font></p>

        was copious and tasty, well worth the 40 crowns we had to
        pay for each. Afterwards we met the only other person in
        our age group (he was only ten years older than us. Yet
        another German bike tourist on his way back to his
        homeland. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The day was utterly
        unbelievable. Big blue sky, fluffy clouds, warm air,
        rolling hills, green forests, no cars, fields of cows,
        charming little cottages, big red barns and great road
        (paved and unpaved). I&#146;d write more about it, but I
        could hardly do it justice. The only downside is that my
        arm and shoulder continued to hurt more than a little.
        Hoping that the next day this problem will fade
        substantially. Lunched on pizza in a restaurant owned by
        a little dude who looked vaguely middle-eastern. He made
        a great pizza and provided the best bargain in Sweden.
        The meal included a salad and beverage for the price of a
        beer. What a surprise.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">We ended up in a
        less-than-charming little burg. Absolutely nothing going
        on this Friday night in Lonsboda. Our hostel
        substantially more expensive and far less glamorous than
        the night before. We ate dinner in (surprise!) a pizza
        restaurant. Where we admired local youths while munching
        a hearty meal. The one thing that is consistent from
        country to country are the loafing teenagers. They all
        wear the same clothes, pierce the same places, wear the
        same outlandish hairstyles and colors, drink and smoke.
        All the time they fancy themselves rebellious not knowing
        that every other teen in the western world is doing the
        same thing.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Tonight I write atop our
        bunk beds listening to our fellow guests&#146; children
        laugh and play in the endless twilight. Wondering if
        they&#146;ll grow to be exactly like the other teens
        we&#146;ve seen.</font></p>

        Kosta, 123km</b></font><p><font size="2" face="Arial">You
        can paint your countryside home in Sweden any color you
        want as long as it is barnyard red with white window and
        door sills. If they feel extremely rebellious (like the
        teens above) they paint the house yellow and the barn is
        the traditional red.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Our day began on a dirt
        road winding through the forest past cute little country
        casas with new Volvos, Saabs and BMW&#146;s parked in the
        driveway. Seemed incongruous to see this fancy machinery
        in front of places where they raise cows for a living.
        The morning route was intended to take us past a string
        of lakes, but somehow we missed a turn and the lakes.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Our next segment sent us
        charging up-and-down hummocky topography through forests,
        past red little houses and by little lakes. (beginning to
        see the pattern?) After 45k I&#146;d grown tired of the
        very little steep routes (my shoulder aching from
        exertion) while Andy was quite happy with them. We agreed
        to split up for 40K until Tingsryd. Andy&#146;s path (he
        reported) sent him charging up-and-down hummocky
        topography. While mine sent me over rolling hills through
        forests, past little villages and lakes. I&#146;d thought
        that I&#146;d be on a relatively busy road, but the
        information signs revealed parallel routes through the
        forests and parks on a gravel biking trail. It was only
        the last few kilometers that forced me onto a busy road.
        The towns I passed looked like pictures from postcards
        with their structures in the traditional colors resting
        by little lakes and streams.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">I made it to Tingsryd
        before Andy and went shopping for lunch, which we ate
        together in the churchyard. We had a revelation at lunch
        and decided that we&#146;d meet Olivier a week earlier
        than planned in Helsinki. We set out to find a phone to
        talk to Olivier. We&#146;d decided that we&#146;d take a
        train this night to Stockholm and be in Finland the next
        day riding. After calling we made our way to Lessebo
        (whose name we joked about endelessly) to catch the
        train. We arrived at the station to find that the next
        one arrived in two hours. At the station there was a
        troop of scouts sleeping on the platform. We tiptoed over
        them and made our way to town to have a coffee, snack and
        shop for a train meal.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">For our snack we stopped
        at a waffle shack in the city park. Appropriately we ate
        waffles with strawberry jam and whipped cream. Our server
        at the shack was fascinated by our tour and bikes and
        mused about being able to take such a trip himself. His
        questions &quot;how can you afford this&quot; reminded us
        of being in the States.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">We were both beginning to
        find Sweden a little boring. We were happy that we&#146;d
        be on a train to Stockholm this night and be in Finland
        (to which we are both virgins) the next day. After
        collecting some bread, crackers, two types of fish
        products, dessert and some water at the market we went
        back to the train station. There the scouts were still
        sleeping and the train was yet to arrive. We waited on
        the platform and jumped up and readied to board as the
        coach arrived. It was a sleek new train without any
        baggage cars and the conductor unceremoniously denied us
        entry and the train pushed on without us. I was furious.
        My shoulder ached and I didn&#146;t know what to do.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Andy wanted to push to the
        next town, but I was not feeling fit to do so. I was so
        enraged that I found the energy to pedal onward over more
        rolling hills through the forest. Off in the distance
        about halfway to Kosta Andy yelled &quot;moooooossseeee,
        stop&quot;. We pulled out the binoculars and watched him
        graze in the distance looking up at us when we yelled at
        him to come closer so we could photograph him. He ignored
        us and continued his evening meal. </font></p>

        the only folks at the hotel. We were proven wrong when in
        the morning a handful of other guests appeared at
        breakfast. We chose to eat outside on the patio and bask
        in the bright morning sun. Checking out the hotel
        deskman, a twenty-something hipster, saw us eying the
        moose brochures and postcards and said, &quot;you know,
        that is my mother,&quot; jokingly. I suppressed a laugh
        noting a family resemblence. We began our day over
        rolling hills through forests. Only difference this time
        is that there were big signs everywhere warning us not to
        take pictures. We also passed by parking lots filled with
        scary looking tanks of chemicals and roads that
        weren&#146;t marked on our map. The path we were on was
        suspiciously wide, especially because we did not see
        another vehicle. The whole time we passed through this
        zone I had the uneasy feeling that we were being watched.
        We got a clue as to the use of the area when we passed a
        large and wide road that turned out to be an airstrip.
        Guns were camouflaged underneath green covers guarding
        what must be a military installation.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Soon we passed through
        this zone and were again allowed to take pictures of the
        rolling hills covered with evergreens. We were greeted by
        a gas station/supermarket at the next town where we
        stocked up on lunch goodies. The sky became increasingly
        more threatening as we exited the village. I noticed for
        the second or third time a sort of monument that I&#146;d
        seen in other backwaters. A large flat sloping rock,
        perhaps 15 meters square, with a rustic stone pillar in
        the center, sort of a phallus. Still haven&#146;t figured
        the cultural significance of these monuments but vow to
        find out eventually.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Andy called me pessimistic
        when I stopped to put on my rain covers over my bags.
        Within fifteen minutes of the act drizzle was falling
        from the sky and it looked like we were to have an
        endless day of rain. Just as we entered the next village
        the sky was falling and we ducked onto the terrace of a
        closed café to snarf our lunch and stay out of the rain.
        An hour later the sky had cleared except for an
        occasional drizzle and we were on a roller coaster ride
        through the most lovely terrain I&#146;d seen in Sweden.
        We were sure that we&#146;d see a moose around any corner
        drinking from a lake or munching on some moss. (we were
        disappointed) One thing that did strike me about the
        Swedish countryside is how orderly it was. We would see a
        pond in the forest and wonder if it had been landscaped.
        Every outdoor scene looked more like a Japanese garden
        than nature. Thinking about Swedish society we pondered
        whether life was imitating nature or the other way
        around. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">This day we discovered
        that anyone over the age of say 40 is a &quot;snecker
        don&#146;t.&quot; This is the term that Mars and Andy
        applied to folks who don&#146;t speak English in Norway.
        It came about because if you asked someone if they spoke
        a language you&#146;d say &quot;Snecker du&#133;?,&quot;
        hence &quot;don&#146;ts&quot;, speak no English.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Our desire to see a moose
        up-close-and-personal was satisfied just as we began to
        enter the suburbs of our destination. A pair of stuffed
        ones were being used as roadside attractions to draw
        folks into a snack shop. We powered through our final
        kilometers. It was the first time in the past days that I
        felt strong again on my bicycle. My shoulder was finally
        not interfering with my riding. Andy trailed in my
        airstream and we averaged 25kph plus in those final
        meters up and down hills.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">We went directly to the
        train station to arrange transport to Stockholm only to
        find yet again that the train to there would not
        accommodate our cycles. We went to the bus station to
        discover that the last bus for the capital had already
        left. We decided to rest that night there and catch a bus
        or rent a car the next day (or worst case, take the boat
        the next day.)</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>4 August, Oskarshamn to
        Stockholm</b></font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">We checked out of our
        hotel and made our way to the bus station. This time I
        was truly pessimistic. The woman at the ticket office
        told me that it would be unlikely that the bus could
        accommodate our bikes. When the bus arrived I checked the
        baggage compartments only to find them really full. We
        decided to ask the driver anyway and he gladly pulled out
        a bike rack and we mounted Siegfried and Roy on the back
        and hopped on the bus. The bus ride took us past more
        rolling hills, forests and spectacular coastlines. It
        stopped every two hundred meters to pick up anyone who
        happened to be standing by the road.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Unlike bus travel in other
        countries, the passengers were gentile, moneyed and
        well-dressed. Many of them received constant calls on
        their cell phones. The woman just in front of us spent
        the entire 4 hour trip fixing her face. Andy surmised she
        must have made a date over the internet and was to see
        him/her for the first time upon arrival in Stockholm.
        When we finally made it there we booked passage on the
        night boat to Turku. We whiled away the hours munching
        lunch, drinking coffee and playing backgammon. We went
        out to a gay café around dinner time and played some
        more backgammon including a game with George, the dude
        operating the café and a Berliner we met there. The
        Berliner kept complaining about the Swedish Water
        Festival. I knew we had nothing in common. </font></p>
