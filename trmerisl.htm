        <td><font face="Arial"><b>Thursday, 2 January 1997,
        Merida to Izamal, 50 miles</b></font><p><font size="2" face="Arial">Mexico seemed so dull after Cuba, full of
        cars and outrageously prosperous. The cars in and around
        Merida were a plague, but I have to admit the Whoppers we
        scarfed down at Burger King in Wannabuyahammock Square
        tasted pretty good. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Our goal for the day was
        Izamal &#150;a flat, featureless ride through fields of
        agave. Even though we fought the wind the whole way and
        didn&#146;t set off until the heat of noon, the ride
        seemed pretty painless. It didn&#146;t take us long to
        figure out that the pope had visited Izamal a few years
        earlier. There were faded newspaper clippings framed and
        hung everywhere, and the entire town had been sanitized
        and painted a signature shade of yellow. We found a funny
        little motel in the outskirts of town, run by a guy who
        collected animals. Outside our door there was a monkey
        tied to a tree and some owls in a cage. The room next to
        us was occupied by an unfriendly middle-aged homo couple
        from Italy. They had passed us in their car several times
        during the days ride, but seemed entirely oblivious to us
        when we rolled into Izamal. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">After a glorious shower,
        we did the tourist thing, visiting first the huge convent
        that Izamal is famous for, and then the towering Mayan
        pyramid which commanded a view for many miles; one could
        even see Chichen Itza, some forty miles away. </font></p>

        <td><font face="Arial"><b>Friday, 3 January 1997, Izamal
        to Chichen-Itza, 49 miles</b></font><p><font size="2" face="Arial">We got an early start the next day in order
        to visit the ruins of Chichen-Itza in the afternoon; even
        the monkey was still asleep. At dawn we carboloaded with
        tacolike things (so many Mexican food names, and they
        seem to vary from town to town) in the marketplace and
        hit the road. Our goal was to get as many miles under our
        belts as we could before the wind kicked up. At about
        mile 15, before 8am, it hit, perhaps stronger than
        previous days and coming straight at us.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The first town out of
        Izamal was painted with the same yellow paint that must
        have been left over from the pope&#146;s visit. In the
        second village we stopped for refrescos on the plaza and
        mused upon Coca Cola&#146;s ingenious &#150;and
        ubiquitous advertising in Mexico. Here the road to
        Chichen-Itza split off, becoming a roller-coaster affair
        which buckled and twisted through the undergrowth &#150;a
        hell of a lot more fun than yesterday&#146;s ride. I
        nearly got flattened by a pair of horses dashing across
        the road in a topetown called Quintana Roo. Other
        roadside sightings include no fewer than two
        freshly-squished foxes (extraordinary considering the
        dearth of traffic), several hunters on their bikes with
        their hounds following, and endless miles of stone fences
        enclosing fields of agave. In Dzitas we turned towards
        the South and got serious relief from the headwind. About
        ten miles down the (undulating) road we crossed the super
        highway connecting Cancun to Merida, and we were
        instantly transported from Mexico unto some other place.
        Car after car zoomed by us towards the famous ruins, each
        with a license plate proclaiming &quot;Avis&quot;,
        &quot;Budget&quot; or &quot;Thrifty.&quot; The
        hurriedness of the cars&#146; occupants was almost
        palpable as they tried to squeeze as much as possible
        into one day before heading back to Cancun.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The we entered Piste, a
        Mexican village that is far from typical, deluged with
        screaming billboards, tour buses and high-speed traffic.
        The unpleasantness of the polace teamed up with the
        intensity of the sun to make me headachey and cranky.
        Compounding this was the enervating process of finding
        our intended hotel, the Mayaland. It involved asking many
        people and backtracking a couple of times, and when we
        finally reached the &quot;reception area&quot;, it was
        nothing more than a palapa and a guy with a
        walkie-talkie. He told us to wait and we felt stupid. But
        after a while we were able to follow a golf cart to the
        actual reception area. Within thirty excruciating minutes
        we were in our glamorous room overlooking the ruins. A
        swim, lunch and a couple of beers made me feel much
        better, but I still didn&#146;t have it in me to be a
        tourist, so I sent Fred out to scope it out while I
        basked in soliturde. He returned far earlier than I had
        anticipated, though, and dragged me through an illegal
        entrance to the site, displaying more energy and
        sparkling attitude than was fair.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Arial"><b>Saturday, 4 January 1997,
        Chichen-Itza to Valladolid, 32 miles</b></font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The next morning we
        sneaked into the ruins and had them to ourselves for over
        an hour. I was impressed by the extent of the
        restorations and the carvings. After a few hours, though,
        we felt like we had pretty much seen the place, and
        headed back to our hotel to pack and jump on our bikes. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The road to Valladolid was
        a nightmare, heavily-trafficked and without a shoulder.
        The headwind felt especially brutal under these
        conditions. An underground swimming hole was a welcome
        stop along the way, although I could have dealt without
        the urchins in the parking lot screaming &quot;watch
        bicycle!&quot; and scamming for pesos. Valladolid itself
        didn&#146;t seem like anything special, but it was
        crowded with daytrippers from Cancun seeking the
        &quot;real Mexico.&quot; We had read that the road from
        here to Cancun wasn&#146;t a viable option for cyclists
        and booked passage on the next available bus, some three
        hours later. To kill time we checked out the Cenote Azul
        in the center of town, and had a lengthy repast in a
        café which looked over it, periodically checking to see
        that our bikes weren&#146;t being molested by the scruffy
        youths hanging out in the parking lot.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Cancun was like a bad
        dream, full of speeding cars, fat tourists and fast-food
        restaurants. Upon arriving we were approached by a
        Frenchman who proposed a room nearby. He didn&#146;t balk
        for an instant when I told him we&#146;d prefer a room
        with a big bed. We thought we&#146;d check out the homo
        scene that night, but I was unable to find the page
        I&#146;d ripped out of the Spartacus Guide, and I took it
        as a sign that we needed an early night&#146;s sleep
        anyway. </font></p>

    <tr>
        <td><font face="Arial"><b>5-8 January 1997, Isla Mujeres,
        42 miles</b></font><p><font size="2" face="Arial">We
        watched the sun rise over the high-rises of Cancun&#146;s
        &quot;Zona Hotelera&quot; from our place&#146;s breakfast
        room before hitting the road. The ferry ride to Isla
        Mujeres didn&#146;t take long, and since we&#146;d be
        staying there for three nights, we were more particular
        than usual in our selection of a room. We scored big-time
        with the Rocamor, a funky little place perched above the
        crashing surf. We quickly learned that the place to be on
        Isla Mujeres was on the beach (which even included a
        homoesque section full of smiling rent-a-boys), where we
        spent the better part of four torpid days vainly trying
        to fill in the gaps of our cyclists&#146; tans and
        familiarizing ourselves with the geography of the local
        happy hours. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">On our first full day on
        the tiny island, we exhausted the place&#146;s touring
        and cycling possibilities by 11am, having visited the
        lame Mayan ruin and a nearby snorkeling spot at the
        opposite tip. After that, it didn&#146;t take us long for
        us to learn that neither of us is cut out for beach
        vacations. The days seemed excruciatingly long for want
        of things to do. Reading, writing and drinking were our
        chief activities on Isla Mujeres. I suppose we attained
        our goal of decompressing after so many days of riding,
        but I think we both would have preferred more riding. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">We were almost relieved
        when the day came to leave for the airport. I was intent
        on getting there by bike, while Fred kept wailing about a
        taxi. Our extremely limited funds necessitated the former
        option, though the pedal through the heinous Hotel Zone
        against an evil wind under threatening skies was anything
        but fun. It seemed to take forever; indeed, we were late
        checking in. The woman at the counter charged me for both
        the boxes and the transport of the bikes, and I was too
        tired to argue with her. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">On the plane back home, I
        could think of little else but our next bike trip.</font></p>
