        <td><font size="2" face="Arial"><strong>Phoenix to Globe,
        19 March 1997, 92 miles&nbsp;</strong></font><p><font size="2" face="Arial">Even after relaxing at Chez Jack
        and Leslie for four days we hadn&#146;t grown too soft to
        climb some 6000 feet today. Though it wasn&#146;t the
        hottest day of the trip it sure seemed that way. Maybe
        the fact that I had sunburned my back working on the
        bikes in the midday sun without a shirt or sun screen
        (&quot;duh&quot; says Andy) contributed to my sensitivity
        to the golden orb. All in all it was a beautiful midday
        framed by two ugly segments.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Leaving Phoenix is a
        bigger challenge than you might imagine; it spreads from
        its center for miles and miles and there are more cars on
        the road than poseurs in Hollywood. Drivers range from
        comatose to ultra-aggressive. The best part of the trek
        out of town was on a bike path where the only obstacle
        was testosterone-infused power walkers. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Once we left Phoenix city
        limits we passed through mile after mile of motor home
        parks that range from elegant to spartan with tag-lines
        like &quot;Motor Resort&quot;, &quot;Mobile
        Estates&quot;, to the downscale &quot;Mobile home park,
        overnighters welcome&quot;. Leaving Apache Junction we
        officially left metro Phoenix and said goodbye to mobile
        life. Even the wind conspired to make it difficult for us
        to leave. Each time we changed course it managed to swing
        around and again blow in our face.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Though the riding was
        tough against the gusting wind, the scenery became
        gorgeous as soon as we ascended to 2000&#146;. Saguaro
        cacti dotted the hills, ocotillo showed their red blooms
        and an amazing perfume from a white flowering desert bush
        tantalized my nose. With this kind of landscape to
        distract us, it became easier to surmount the rolling
        terrain with the breeze in our face. Little hills gave
        way to bigger ones and the scenery became even more
        dramatic as we approached our lunching spot at the
        botanical gardens near Superior, AZ as we rolled into
        copper country.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Jack has joined us to
        support our ride to El Paso and get in a little riding
        with us. He met us with a splendid picnic that included
        &quot;greek bread&quot; with spinach and feta cooked into
        it. &quot;It smells like a baked fart but tastes
        great,&quot; quipped Jack. I couldn&#146;t manage to make
        the tour of the garden, too wacked by the heat so I
        napped on the bench while Andy and Jack had a father/son
        outing. I woke to the local Audaban (sp?) Society
        representative concluding her senior birding class
        lecture just before Andy and Jack reappeared. They missed
        the moving poem which had inspired me to hit the road.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The next miles out of
        Superior would be the most lovely and the most
        challenging of the day. As we ascended nearly 2500 feet
        up Devil&#146;s Canyon we were treated to sweeping views
        of craggy outcrops, spring cactus and a generous shoulder
        to ride on. The signs on the road were more than a little
        perplexing. We were so inspired to see &quot;6%
        downgrade, next 12 miles&quot; we almost cried after our
        horrendous climb --only to swing around a corner as we
        descended to see a massive uphill ahead. Two more times
        the sadistic signers tried to fool us into thinking we
        would go downhill uninterrupted for a long period of time
        only to find nasty hills that we had to mount.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Rolling into the globe
        metro area we found the rural American trinity
        --McDonald&#146;s, Walmart, and Taco Bell-- signifying
        that we were back in civilization and close to our final
        destination for the day. Andrew was almost run off the
        road by the &quot;butthead of the day&quot;, a bearded
        driver of a Chevy Camaro Arizona license &quot;MT
        1666&quot;, hope he is reading this. He managed to drive
        onto the shoulder to nearly miss Andy though there was no
        other traffic on the road. Andrew was still fuming over
        the incident as we arrived at the Cloud Nine Hotel as the
        sun started to set. We were greeted by the mascot of the
        establishment as she darted from Jack&#146;s room. Stella
        the sharpay ran up to us demanding to be pet while her
        nipples dragged on the ground. A major Mexican meal and
        coffee at one of Globe&#146;s happening nightspots capped
        the evening. I lost consciousness and began snoring as
        soon as my head hit the pillow.</font></p>

        <td><font size="2" face="Arial"><strong>Globe to Safford,
        20 March 1997, 77 Miles</strong>&nbsp;</font><p><font size="2" face="Arial">I knew it would happen eventually,
        so it came almost as a relief. Some twenty miles out of
        Globe, in the heart of the San Carlos Apache Nation
        Reservation, a half-filled beer can was flung at us from
        a passing vehicle. The injun ambush angle made the event
        slightly more bearable, and we were happy to find plenty
        of the perpetrator&#146;s more friendly brethren at a
        nearby grocery store &#150; a sort of Apache 7-11. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">From San Marcos the road
        became more rolling, just as the receptionist at our digs
        in Globe had warned me. In the desert,
        &quot;rolling&quot; is a euphemism for some serious ups
        and downs, and once again the wind wasn&#146;t
        cooperating with us. But the scenery was spectacular, and
        anytime that I felt hot I&#146;d look off to my right at
        snow-covered peaks. The wind worsened as we descended
        into the Gila River valley just before our designated
        lunch stop in another Indigenous American hellhole called
        Bylas. We picnicked in the only shade around, next to the
        town&#146;s only grocery store, which proved a good
        vantage point for checking out the local denizens. Most
        of the vehicles had &quot;JESUS&quot; emblazoned on their
        front license plates, and I gawked at a pair of seriously
        obese squaws.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">It took us a while to get
        motivated for the remaining 30 miles to Safford, which
        lay directly upwind, and no sooner had we started
        pedaling than a big black dog leapt out of nowhere to
        attack Fred. But Fred was prepared with pepper spray,
        which he released in an effective cloud at precisely the
        right moment. It was the first time either of us had been
        able to put the stuff to use, and was therefore highly
        satisfying.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Another seriously obese
        Apache &#150;this one a brave--gawked at us from inside
        his parked car in a place called Fort Thomas. We went
        through the now-familiar saw of explaining how we&#146;re
        on our way to Florida (whenever we tell anyone of our
        plans beyond that, it kind of throws people, so
        we&#146;ve learned not to emphasize the mostly
        international nature of this trip), to which the Indian
        pointed westwards and told us we were going the wrong
        way. Civilization reared its ugly head some thirteen
        miles further down the windswept road. Roadside signs
        signaled the presence of a Tastee Freeze coming into
        Pima, where we stopped for Fred&#146;s daily dose of
        rootbeer float. Three little boys came up on BMX-type
        bikes and asked us where we were headed. When we told
        them Florida, they echoed the kids we ran into last week
        with a chorus of disbelieving &quot;Nuh-uh&#146;s&quot;</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Also in Pima, we spotted a
        weird-looking guy lounging in a park with his loaded-down
        bike. He was dressed in hardcore Ashram wear --beads, a
        white robe and a turban&#151;and presumably rode barefoot
        since his feet were filthy. He said he was called Brother
        Richard and came from Tucson, and then he launched into
        his prophet routine, repeating several times &quot;We
        should eat things that come from the ground.&quot; The
        eternal smartass, I asked him in a deadpan voice if
        rootbeer floats came from the ground, since that was the
        last thing we had eaten. A pause ensued, followed by a
        solemnly pronounced &quot;The rootbeer does.&quot; When
        we asked Brother Richard where he was headed he responded
        enigmatically, &quot;To the ten.&quot; Leaving him, I
        wondered if we&#146;ll someday become two more
        shell-shocked psycho cyclists.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Dad and the truck bearing
        our gear were nowhere to be found in Safford, so we
        jumped into our motel&#146;s pool with our slimy biking
        clothes, figuring that the chlorine would help sanitize
        them. When Dad showed up only minutes later, he said
        he&#146;d been out hitting golf balls at the local
        driving range, and proceeded to kick my ass in backgammon
        while my clothes dried by the pool. Dinner was
        surprisingly good (and copious) Chinese food, and now
        it&#146;s feeling like time for bed even though the clock
        doesn&#146;t yet read ten p.m. From the map, tomorrow
        looks like a challenging day, with lots of climbing. </font></p>

        Buckkhorn, NM, 21 March 1997, 80 Miles</strong>&nbsp;</font><p><font size="2" face="Arial">Whatta day! Dramatic desert
        landscape and elevations held our attention while we
        pumped up merciless hills. We hit our highest elevation
        and top speeds to date. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Leaving Safford we
        actually felt a chill which was short lived. Level,
        straight and beautiful scrubby desert was just beginning
        to bloom. The road quickly shrugged level and we began to
        climb steadily over our first mountain pass. Very little
        traffic to contend with made it a tolerable trip. After
        climbing for a few hours we were treated to a long steady
        and fast downhill. As we descended it was hard to ignore
        what lay before us.&nbsp;</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">As we dropped into a town
        (town is generous, more like where three highways meet)
        called Three Way we couldn&#146;t help but look at what
        was before us. 10 miles of the meanest road you can
        imagine boasting a greater than 2500&#146; ascent through
        the desert. The wild flowers and rocky crags nearly
        distracted us from the high temperatures. Just as we were
        about to crash, Jack&#146;s chow wagon rolled up. We
        snarfed chinese food leftovers and hit the trail. At the
        top the flora changed dramatically, pine trees and
        rolling hills greeted us. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">At the New Mexico Border
        we paused for a moment and then hit glorious downhill
        number two. Again the terrain changed and rolling hills
        and grass were our new surroundings. At times the hills
        were more than rolling. Andy kept saying, this is
        probably the last hill for the day over and over again
        until I shamed him into stopping. The miracle is that for
        the first time the wind was blowing us from behind and
        pushed my aching body into Buckhorn. &nbsp;</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">In Buckhorn we rolled into
        the local RV park set up camp and called it a night. Our
        first night camping for the trip. As we unloaded our gear
        little Nathan, a five year-old on bicycle pedaled up and
        said hello. After just a few moments his witchy mom
        summoned him and we showered in the elegant club house
        and shuffled off to dinner. Hoping for a view of the
        comet tonight&#133;&nbsp;</font></p>

        Silver City, 22 March 1997, 39 Miles</strong>&nbsp;</font><p><font size="2" face="Arial">There was no place to get breakfast
        &#150;or even coffee&#151;in Buckhorn. We had learned the
        previous day, however, that a café in Gila, some ten
        miles away, might be open. So we left our cozy trailer
        and hopped on our bikes just after the sun rose and
        pedaled through the near-freezing cold, feeling sorry for
        ourselves. The café was worth the effort, though, run by
        a hippyesque woman and frequented by characters like a
        spidery, hyperactive guy called Strider, who worked as a
        ranger in a nearby wilderness area. The only choice for
        breakfast was a delicious concoction of vegetables and
        potatoes, served by the proprietress&#146;s ten-year-old
        son. We dawdled there for well over an hour, waiting for
        some incredible green scones to come out of the oven. By
        the time we got back on our bikes, it was much warmer,
        though neither of us felt terribly motivated. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The road to Silver City
        included a very tough climb over the Continental Divide,
        where I stopped to pee into two oceans. We met Dad in a
        recommended lunch spot in the center of the funky old
        mining town, and found lodgings in an old hotel down the
        street. The day&#146;s short mileage was planned; I
        wanted to see the Gila cliff dwellings some fifty miles
        away, and thought visiting them by car would be simpler
        than biking over the Continental Divide twice more. So we
        hopped into Dad&#146;s motorized behemoth and followed a
        windy, steep road through forests and canyons. The cliff
        dwellings were in a beautiful setting near the source of
        the Gila River, and were home to fewer than a hundred
        Mogollon Indians for a brief period in the thirteenth
        century. On the way back to Silver City, we saw several
        mule deer and more Mountain Bluebirds than you can shake
        a stick at.</font></p>

        seemed like deja vu, just two days before I had exclaimed
        of our incredible ascent reaching our highest elevations
        of our bicycling careers. The record was short lived.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">On this bright and cold
        Sunday morning breakfast was the first priority. We set
        out to find an appropriate spot to feed my tape worm only
        to discover that there aren&#146;t very many breaky
        opportunities in Silver City. The first attempt was
        obviously a mistake. While Jack sought a paper we went
        into Grandma&#146;s restaurant in search of pancakes.
        After seating ourselves we noted the eerie feeling of an
        eating experience about to go awry. The only waitress
        serving about 20 tables greeted us with an impatient,
        &quot;I&#146;ll be right with you.&quot; We looked around
        the room and noticed that every patron had a menu and no
        one looked like they were happy with the service. We went
        across the street to another diner and were relieved that
        it seemed to be a money making operation with servers and
        happy patrons. There we chowed and then hit the trail.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">By the time we finished
        munching the temp had climbed to riding temperature and
        we had to shed our sweatshirts within a few miles.
        Somehow I drove the chainwheel cogs into the back of my
        ankle while we were stopped and within a few moments I
        watched the first letting of blood of the trip.
        Fortunately it wasn&#146;t to painful or unsightly.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">We rolled through the
        little mining towns east of Silver City climbing and
        descending hundreds of feet each time. First water stop
        we had a look at the kneeling nun, a butte that looks
        like a sister praying across an alter just past the
        largest open pit copper mine I&#146;ve ever seen.
        She&#146;s probably hoping that some day they&#146;ll
        manage to restore the abomination back to its original
        state. As ugly as it is awesome the whole is two square
        miles and 1800&#146; deep. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Following the mine we
        swept down some 1200&#146; to the bottom of the days
        monumental ascent. For the next 15 miles we were to climb
        2500++&#146; to reach the pass which stands at
        8250&#146;. Seemed really daunting at the bottom until we
        rounded a bend and the wind hit us from behind and seemed
        to propel us up the hill. In the whole ascent I only hit
        granny gears (the smallest forward chainring and the
        easiest to pedal) once or twice. As we mounted the pass
        the desert yielded to pine trees and the temperature
        dropped and the wind from behind became more and more
        intense. At exactly the right moment Jack&#146;s catering
        service arrived and we huddled in the car escaping the
        wind and cold. The sense of accomplishment upon reaching
        the top was great, but hard to revel in knowing that we
        had another 55 miles or more to go.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The descent nearly made me
        find religion. We roared down the hill with the wind at
        our backs essing around the hairpin turns. Passing
        through a little town we saw what I thought to be an
        ostrich being walked by an old goon through town. Andy
        corrected me, it was an emu. No, New Mexicans have not
        taken to keeping oversized birds as pets, seems that 15
        of these future birdburgers had escaped and this emu
        rancher was collecting them.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">We shot eastward with a
        wind at our back for over 30 miles, it was exhilarating,
        which made it all the more frustrating when we turned
        south to find that this tailwind was not as friendly as a
        crosswind. We had our first mini-tiff, Andy frustrated
        over my insistence that I thought this was a headwind.
        Finally heeding Andrew we fought it and commiserated
        until we turned some fifteen degrees west and the wind
        became our friend again. Which leads me to my binary
        theory of the elements. They are either your friend or
        enemy, rarely are they neutral. Today one element
        rendered another neutral, the wind canceled out gravity
        as we ascended Emory Pass.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Literally blew into Hatch,
        the chili capital of the world. Without energy and
        motivation and with a huge desire to see the Simpsons and
        X-files we ate at the nexus of Hatch culture right there
        in the parking lot of the hotel, Dairy Queen. The menu
        diverged from the standard, offering fresh hatch chilies
        on everything but the sundaes.</font></p>

        Paso, TX, 25 March 1997, 84 miles</strong></font><p><font size="2" face="Arial">We have made it to Texas, and are
        treating ourselves to some much-deserved luxury at an
        elegant old hotel in funky downtown El Paso. The Mexican
        border is just a few blocks away, and out our window we
        can see hundreds of cars lined up to get into El Norte.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Getting here from Hatch
        wasn&#146;t as easy as it should have been. Though the
        road was mostly flat, the wind coming out of the West
        nearly blew us over with its gale-force gusts, and the
        moments were it was directly at our backs were woefully
        few. The first ten miles out of Hatch was one of those
        moments; we averaged nearly twenty miles an hour with
        practically zero effort. We followed the course of the
        Rio Grande along a deserted country road, passing through
        countless pecan groves and fields full of baby chilies.
        An added treat was sighting two road runners doing their
        roadrunner thing across our path. But once we neared Las
        Cruces, the wind had really become a problem, blowing
        dust into all our exposed orifices and coating our right
        sides in topsoil. We weren&#146;t feeling too pretty by
        the time we reached our lunch spot in La Mesilla, a
        Disneyfied tourist trap where Billy the Kid was condemned
        to hang. Lunch was long and tasty, in a gorgeous old
        place called the Double Eagle, and I figured a margarita
        would help me endure the fifty-odd windy miles that lay
        ahead.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">--I ought to have ordered
        a second. The wind was so bad after lunch that the whole
        valley was filled with dust, making visibility difficult
        and fraying our nerves. I kept having Wizard of Oz
        flashbacks and tried to keep my mind off where we were
        and what we were doing. But the thought kept creeping
        back into my head: &quot;I&#146;m committing the next two
        years of my life to <i>this</i>?&quot; </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">It took forever to make
        our way through the sprawl of El Paso, and Texan drivers
        seemed ruder than their New Mexican counterparts. To make
        matters worse, our route left the river to climb into the
        Franklin Mountains before heading into downtown. But we
        endured, and when we spotted our hotel in the distance it
        was like seeing a vision, a mirage. The bellmen dealt
        with our bikes efficiently, and the receptionist seemed
        only slightly revolted by our filthy state. Showers
        rejuvenated us, as did drinks in the hotel&#146;s
        fabulous old bar, where we met a drunk old
        Mexican-American called Raul who owned a polo field we
        had passed earlier that day. He told us more than
        you&#146;d ever want to know about the sport, and we were
        very careful not to invite him along to dinner in the
        adjacent dining room, where the meal was divine and
        served in grand style. I ate more than I had previously
        thought humanly possible, and Fred and I indulged in a
        bottle of Chateauneuf du Pape before heading upstairs for
        the tail end of the Oscar hoopla on the tube.</font></p>
