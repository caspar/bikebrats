        <td><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>El Paso to Van Horn,
        27 March 1997, 122 miles</b></font><p><font size="2" face="Arial">I reset my expectations for Texas even lower
        than I had when we began planning the journey a few days
        before while riding into El Paso. We rode through miles
        of congested suburbs while being passed by inconsiderate
        Texans who honked as they passed too closely. I was
        readied for the worst experience. Slowly my opinion began
        to swing as we checked into our hotel and sampled their
        cuisine.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">While El Paso is not
        Paris, it is charming, uncrowded and the people were
        genuinely friendly. I was almost sad to leave. We had an
        especially fun night at the Briar Patch, the local queer
        watering hole where we met an incredible cast of
        characters. One was Hector, the day barman taking a
        &quot;busman&#146;s holiday&quot; hanging out at the bar
        after his shift. Conversing with him we began to
        understand the effect our trip has on people. Hector
        immediately told us he was jealous and envious, which
        made Andrew very uncomfortable. Andy tried to get Hector
        to admit that he could do something like this himself if
        he really wanted to. Hector would not concede. He&#146;d
        been saddled with three kids when his sister died a few
        years earlier. The next day I had a different experience
        when I was speaking to the woman who manages my health
        insurance benefits. Only this time when I said &quot;you
        shouldn&#146;t be jealous,&quot; she snapped back
        &quot;you&#146;re right, I should do it myself!&quot; The
        trip helps people like her to understand that there are
        possibilities beyond the traditional.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Back to Texas. As we left
        the hotel later than normal I anticipated a really short
        day. My left Achilles tendon was bothering me and I had
        little or no energy. I should have felt great; we&#146;d
        had an early evening having watched a movie in the room
        &quot;Ghost and the Darkness&quot;. It was terrible, an
        embarrassment to Andrew&#146;s hero, Val Kilmer. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">There was a stiff wind at
        our side as we pumped out of town. Further hindering our
        egress was Andy&#146;s third flat. Somehow we managed to
        get out of town and the wind from the side evolved to a
        partial tail wind blowing us down the road. We were
        moving along very quickly even though we were loaded with
        about 55# of stuff each. We rolled into Fort Hancock
        after some 50 miles and I was ready for lunch. First we
        tried a very lame grocery store; as we entered a rodent
        masquerading as a Chihuahua greeted us standing on its
        hind legs doing a little dance. There was nothing edible
        there for lunch so we headed for the center of town in
        search for chow.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">After a pizza we hit the
        road and let the wind do its thing. It powered us over
        miles and miles until we hit our hill of the day. It
        wasn&#146;t so bad, only about 1200 feet over eight
        miles. About a third of the way up we stopped at a truck
        stop that advertised a live tiger. And when we arrived we
        saw the youngster in his cage in a gasoliney Quonset hut
        with adhesive tape on his hind legs. It was the saddest
        moment of the journey for me to see such a regal beast
        relegated to such quarters and conditions. He had been
        injured as a baby when someone dropped him. I
        couldn&#146;t help thinking of him as a sad little ghost
        in the darkness.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">We felt glorious when we
        reached the to; we had a downgrade and a tailwind. The
        two elements combined made for a very rapid descent. When
        we reached the town we had anticipated stopping in after
        some ninety miles, we were both still buzzed on
        adrenaline. It was getting late, but it was only
        thirty-three more miles to the next town. With the wind
        we were sure to make it by sundown; if not we had our
        lights. When the sun set we still had ten miles to go. We
        made short work of the last ten miles and found ourselves
        self-satisfied with the fact that our first loaded day
        was high mileage with a big ascent.</font></p>

        <td><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>Van Horn to Alpine, 28
        March, 107 miles</b></font><p><font size="2" face="Arial">Today
        we saw lots of deer and antelope, but none of them were
        acting very playful; and while we rode through vast
        amounts of range, there were precious few homes. Still,
        I&#146;m finding myself increasingly fond of Texas in
        spite of my former prejudices.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The first forty miles
        along the surprisingly quiet US 90 were mostly flat and
        boring. Aside from a ghost town for sale called Lobo, we
        saw virtually no signs of civilization before rolling
        into a borderline ghost town called Valentine, where we
        stopped for lunch at the Chat &#145;n&#146; Nibble café.
        The menu was exactly what I had anticipated and dreaded:
        strictly burgers and chicken fried steak on toast (which
        Fred somehow managed to ingest). And when we inquired
        about our beverage choices, the moody and generously
        proportioned owner went to the kitchen to find out,
        returning to inform us curtly, &quot;We have water,
        coffay and tay.&quot; But the place held a few surprises.
        Parked outside was a donkey, which belonged to a freakish
        looking woman sitting at the counter. She was working a
        grunge Jackie O. goes to Santa Fe sort of look, wearing
        big dark glasses and a surprising variety of cowboy
        &#145;n&#146; injun regalia. The donkey was similarly
        attired, covered in numerous multicolored blankets with
        all sorts of apparati tied onto his saddle. Both donkey
        and owner were painfully thin (though not for lack of
        food, it seems, since the donkey took one bite of an
        apple I offered him and promptly spit it out). We never
        learned the names of either the woman or her animal, due
        to her decidedly aloof bearing. She was much more into
        nibbling than chatting (indeed, she chewed mysteriously
        over her empty plate the entire time we were there), but
        the other patrons told us that she lived nearby and often
        rode her donkey as far away as Arizona &#150;a fact which
        blew me away and earned her my utmost respect. Sitting at
        the table next to us were three friendly cowboy types who
        told us about our choices of routes ahead. We could
        either continue on the road we were on, which was flat,
        or take the more scenic route into the mountains through
        a place called Fort Davis. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">After yesterday&#146;s
        megaride, Fred was very understandably tempted to go the
        easier way, but I enticed him by saying we could probably
        find an espresso in Fort Davis. He gasped in disbelief at
        this absurd statement, and bet me a coffee that there
        would be no such thing within two hundred miles of the
        place. He even sweetened the deal by saying he would eat
        three of the nasty Oreo granola bars he purchased that
        morning in less than three minutes if I could find him an
        iced mocha. Since there was no way to know who was right
        without going there, I had him pretty much trapped into
        climbing.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Even with a tailwind, it
        wasn&#146;t easy. But the scenery more than compensated
        for our efforts. The deserted road twisted through
        rolling pasture land, where the cattle, deer and antelope
        all looked at us bewilderedly. I also spotted a squished
        bobcat being eaten by a buzzard. And at the top we passed
        by a line of twelve huge windmills we had spotted hours
        earlier. From there we whooshed down the final twenty
        miles into Fort Davis (yes, named after Jefferson Davis),
        a cutsie, touristy type town crawling with well-heeled
        city types in their sports utility vehicles. It took me
        all of thirty seconds to find Fred an iced mocha. He held
        up his side of the bargain, but gave me grief for
        gloating over my victory, which I found ironic in view of
        his having ridiculed me constantly during the previous
        three hours into being so foolish as to think that one
        could obtain espresso in rural Texas. I wish I had
        insisted on five Oreo granola bars.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">From Fort Davis we dropped
        through the redrocked splendor of the Musquiz canyon,
        full of thrusting spires, cube-shaped boulders and
        fragrant yucca blossoms. The canyon spit us out onto the
        grassy plain which contains Alpine, our evening&#146;s
        destination.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Even from a distance, the
        small town of Alpine looked strikingly &#150;even
        eerily&#151;prosperous. We soon found that the gigantic
        structure on a hill on the outskirts of town housed the
        Texas State Hospital for Mental Illness and Retardation.
        We&#146;ve landed a tastefully refurbished room in an
        elegant old hotel whose only drawback is its location
        across from the train yard, and have just returned from
        what is very likely the best meal we&#146;ve had on this
        trip. Even after two consecutive hundred-mile-plus days
        (we&#146;re considering renaming ourselves
        &quot;bikestuds&quot;), we couldn&#146;t quite finish the
        cowboy-sized portions at the truly fabulous Reata
        Restaurant. The place specializes in &quot;Texas and
        Cowboy cuisine&quot;, which is something I would have
        scoffed at before tonight; and I&#146;m glad to have had
        my preconceptions shattered.</font></p>

        <td><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>Alpine to Sanderson,
        29 March, 87 miles</b></font><p><font size="2" face="Arial">Our cake walk through Texas came to a
        dramatic conclusion (and marked the end of the short
        reign of the &#145;bikestuds&#146;). Mother Nature showed
        us what it was like to ride in non-miraculous conditions.
        A high gray ceiling of clouds and consistent
        non-favorable winds, all combined with several good
        climbs, put an end to effortless 100 mile days. Andy and
        I looked at one another and sang our bad day anthem
        &quot;I-H-N-E&quot; countless times before lunch. (IHNE =
        I have no energy)</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">We dragged our fatigued
        butts into another cute little Texas tourist town,
        Marathon, just after noon and looked for the best
        lunching ground we could find. The Gage Hotel fit the
        bill and we brought our bikes into the patio so we could
        see them. We weren&#146;t the most fashionably dressed
        patrons but everyone was interested in us, our bikes and
        our journey. Especially a bearded dude who offered us a
        place to stay in Houston. The local specialty was
        &quot;chicken fried chicken&quot; which sounded a little
        redundant but tasted just fine. The waitress refilled my
        coffee with tea, inventing a new drink which I
        wouldn&#146;t recommend.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The afternoon was most
        frustrating. It involved a massive descent into a
        headwind. Through 54 of the most desolate miles I&#146;ve
        ever ridden. No gas station, no store, no operating
        businesses whatsoever, a total depravation of
        civilization. It made rolling into nearly deserted
        Sanderson like arriving in Manhattan. Once a railroad
        town, Sanderson without the trains is a shadow of its
        former self at first glance. Against the recommendation
        of the prim and proper tourist information lady, we chose
        to rest at the Motel Sanderson, formerly Frank&#146;s
        Motel. Why the new owners chose a new name we will never
        know; after all, think of the brand equity, not to
        mention the 40&#146; long neon sign now rendered
        worthless.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The proprietor was an
        amazing geezer. His first question to us was &quot;one or
        two beds?&quot; When we asked for two his unflinching
        response was: &quot;Personaly, I&#146;d rather sleep with
        a wet dog than another man.&quot; Within a few moments of
        our meeting we knew the story of his two dogs recent
        deaths as well as the unfortunate recent demise of his
        wife.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Once showered we put our
        minds to setting Sanderson, population 900, on fire.
        Walking down the street we were flagged down by the
        marginalized population of the town. They were having
        margies on the porch of their store at sunset watching
        the traffic trickle through town. They invited us to sit
        and have a cold one. Jack, Cliff, Lloyd, and Lloyd&#146;s
        daughter Kristin dished the town gossip and quizzed us
        about the trip. We thought them all to be members of our
        club, with the possible exception of Lloyd and Daughter.
        There were a few subtle &quot;tells&quot; like
        Jack&#146;s t-shirt depicting a geologic formation that
        looked distinctly like male genitalia and the tasteful
        decor of the store. We did our best to lay our hand on
        the table by talking about opera. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Jack and Cliff pointed us
        to the only dinner possibility in town. Walking down the
        main drag Andy tripped over a tumbleweed in front of the
        non-functioning cinema. We passed vacant storefront after
        vacant storefront on our way to the diner. The last
        establishment before the Kountry Kitchen was billed as
        &quot;Texas&#146; smallest Ford dealership&quot;. The
        only game in town for dinner was packed --not a single
        free table and we were not the only party waiting. Our
        hostess, waitress and busgirl asked us to wait while she
        cleared some tables. As she finished bussing the tables a
        pair of drunk locals displayed their consideration and
        charm by taking the tables just as they cleared. Bouncer
        was added to our multi-talanted hostess&#146; resume as
        she made room for us and the pair of aging lesbians with
        their handicapped foster child.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Andy and I both opted for
        a beer and jalapeno cheeseburgers. In a moment of
        weakness I added bacon to achieve the maximum caloric
        value possible. This, in retrospect, was an error on my
        part. Fortunately we both avoided the &quot;taco
        pollocko&quot; a concoction that seemed to be an
        enchilada with a polish sausage rolled in it. Following
        our gastronomic adventure it was my turn to trip over a
        tumbleweed on our way to find a suitable bar.
        Nancy&#146;s, billed to be the town&#146;s hotspot was
        beat. Andrew liked it because they flattered him by
        carding him but I overruled him and we set off for the
        Cantina. A beer and a game of pool were the perfect tonic
        to forget a tough day of riding. After pocket billiards
        we stumbled upon a copy of the 1971 Sanderson School
        yearbook, &quot;El Aguila.&quot; Just as we were deciding
        that young Cliffie McSomethingorother was hot in 1971,
        Cliff from earlier came up to us and told us that this
        was his yearbook and proceeded to show us his picture.
        Cliff and Cliffie were one and the same. We bought him a
        cold one while he came clean about being queer and began
        to tell us about every homo in Sanderson. It became clear
        that there were many M.O.T.&#146;s (members of our tribe)
        in town and we wondered what was in the water (which
        everyone said was great) in Sanderson. Just as it was
        becoming interesting the proprietor, Alberto, another
        brother, came up to introduce himself. This coincided
        with the end of peace in my stomach. I excused myself and
        began to walk back to the hotel. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">I only made it a few steps
        until I was stopped in my tracks by my gastrointestinal
        turmoil. The soul of my dinner left my body along with
        its body. I barfed in the bushes, and before I walked
        away a mange (a mangy dog) was having dinner. I retired
        to the &quot;Bates Motel&quot; (as Jack and Cliff
        referred to it) while more of Sanderson&#146;s homo
        underbelly was revealed to Andy. [see below]</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">[It&#146;s true; La
        Cantina was essentially a queer bar that night, from
        butch narcoleptic Susan playing darts with her gay pal
        Roland to a confused Mexican boy called Alex who flirted
        with me shamelessly. Out on the porch Cliff told me how
        he met Jack in Austin and how they decided to come back
        to Cliff&#146;s birthplace in order to transform the town
        and update some of its attitudes. He also told me all
        sorts of local tales. The abandoned buffalo burger joint
        we had passed midway between Marathon and Sanderson going
        out of business due to litigation around a bobcat bite;
        the fey but closeted high school principal; the
        difficulties of ranching and the unfortunate necessity of
        panther hunting. Cliff&#146;s boyfriend Jack showed up,
        followed by the incomparable, larger-than-life Chris, who
        plans to move to San Antonio as soon as he graduates from
        Sanderson High. In the meantime, he seems committed to
        shaking up his town and earning the title of &quot;most
        likely to pursue a career in drag artistry&quot; in this
        year&#146;s edition of &quot;El Aguila&quot;. The whole
        outrageous cast of characters reminded me of John
        Sayles&#146; movie &quot;Lone Star.&quot; --ab]</font></p>

        <td><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>Sanderson to Comstock,
        30 March, 90 miles</b></font><p><font size="2" face="Arial">The day&#146;s overabundance of nothingness
        nearly inspired me to compose some West Texas haiku, but
        I managed to restrain myself. Ninety miles, and not so
        much as a cow to look at.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">It was Easter Sunday, and
        for the first time on our trip, we woke up to a gray,
        cold day. I had learned from Chris (Sanderson&#146;s Most
        Flamboyant Teen 1997) that Shamrock Gas &#150;where he
        happened to work-- was the only breakfast in town, and I
        wanted him to be a surprise to Fred. He was
        uncharacteristically subdued, however, as we munched on
        microwaved treats and assembled the best picnic lunch
        that we could. We heard lots more local dish from Chris
        and saw some of the people we had met or seen the
        previous evening coming in to buy gas and/or donuts, and
        it struck me again how weird and wonderful it must be to
        grow up in such a place, where everyone knows everyone
        else&#146;s business. As we rolled out into the cold, I
        marveled at how quickly little Sanderson and its
        courageous queer community had managed to ingratiate
        itself on me. More than any town we&#146;ve biked through
        so far, it&#146;s the place I&#146;d most like to return
        to someday.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">It was a long, painful
        ride on the highway 90 roller-coaster. Every turn greeted
        us with new vistas encompassing endless rolling plains of
        scrub desert. Our first stop was at a gas station/general
        store in a place called Dryden, which was apparently a
        town once upon a time. A Mexican cowboy ran the place,
        and after telling us about the bicyclists he&#146;d seen
        recently, he re-immersed himself in his reading of
        &quot;Lonesome Dove.&quot; The only other clients were
        two homo German motorcyclists who kept complaining how
        cold it was and that they might as well have remained in
        Stuttgart.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Fred suffered his first
        flat of the trip just after we made the evil climb out of
        Lozier Canyon; we took it as a sign to stop for our
        ersatz picnic of tortillas and cheese purchased in Van
        Horn and gas station tuna supplied by Chris. Then Chris
        and Cliff themselves showed up in a shiny red pickup not
        too many miles later, bearing more food and some
        much-needed words of comfort and praise. Against my
        Yankee upbringing, I have been converted to a lifetime
        defender of the great state of Texas. I can&#146;t recall
        ever meeting so many friendly and genuine people.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Nothing lay between where
        we said farewell to Cliff and Chris and our day&#146;s
        destination besides Langtry, named after nineteenth
        century singer-courtesan Lilly Langtry, and now a ghost
        town and minor tourist attraction. We didn&#146;t tarry
        here, though, since we still had nearly thirty miles to
        pedal and the light was already fading. It was pitch
        black by the time we finally rolled into Comstock, where
        the motel and every other business in town appeared
        closed. But just as we resigned to having to pitch a
        tent, the Mexican guy who owned the motel showed up in
        his pickup. He helped us find dinner by calling his
        friend Emilio down the hill, who not only fixed Fred two
        dinners to go, but drove him and his bike back up to the
        motel, where I lay in a near-comatose state. In a
        departure from previous nights, I had no problem at all
        falling asleep just after Fred.</font></p>

        <td><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>Comstock to Del Rio,
        31 March, 31 miles </b></font><p><font size="2" face="Arial">The sky looked menacing and gray from the
        moment we woke after 10 hours of sleep in our second bad
        bed in as many days. Mounted our bikes, braved the
        drizzle and headed to Emilio&#146;s for a much
        anticipated hearty breakfast. Emilio and spouse were
        nowhere to be seen, so we went back towards the motel and
        had our morning meal there. As we ate we watched the rain
        fall. Our fellow patrons all knew one another and the
        conversation was spirited and jocular. We could tell this
        only from their tone because the words were completely
        unintelligible to our untrained ears. Everyone sounded
        roughly like the redneck character from &quot;King of the
        Hill&quot; named Boomhauser(sp?), whose elocution is
        equivalent to an auctioneer overdosing on Valium.
        Surprisingly everyone did speak English and when they
        addressed us they made special efforts to be understood.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">While procrastinating over
        coffee, we watched our fellow patrons&#146; dogs howl as
        the rain fell on them in the back of their owners' pickup
        trucks, neither of us very interested in riding in the
        rain no matter how short the distance. I looked at this
        as an opportunity to check out the effectiveness of our
        rain gear. Andrew, however, was less enthusiastic. He
        discovered his booties (rain shoes for bicyclists) did
        not fit over his cycling shoes. Finally we hit the road
        and pedaled for Del Rio. Save the rain the trip was
        uneventful if seemingly without end. When the end of the
        ride was reached I stood dripping pathetically in the
        lobby of the Ramada asking for a cyclist discount. No
        mercy granted; we only received the AAA discount (a bit
        ironic when you think about it), but the clerk agreed to
        comp us breakfast if we could come up with some complaint
        about the accommodation by morning.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The afternoon in Del Rio
        introduced both of us to new aspects of American culture.
        On our way into town we both noticed a mall with a
        theater playing &quot;Selena: the movie&quot; and a Wall
        Mart. Wall Mart was an experience for which neither of us
        was ready. We stopped into the café for a coffee and
        watched the American version of the French sidewalk
        experience unfold for us. After achieving a sufficient
        caffeine buzz we set out on our shopping adventure. We
        were both ready to cry, the abundance was shocking. There
        was an entire aisle of dandruff shampoo (perhaps this is
        a big problem in Del Rio). We were ready to give up and
        go somewhere else less confusing for the items we needed
        when we found someone to ask about their location. This
        Wall Mart samaritan did everything but lead us by the
        hand to find our products. Even then it was confusing to
        pick from the gazillian types of ziplock bags. In the end
        we made it out of the store with enough time to make the
        movie and barely enough cash to pay for it.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Selena was a
        disappointment, not campy enough to be funny and not well
        written enough to be believable. The one thing that was
        &quot;on&quot; was its target audience. They were there
        in force singing along with the songs, ooh-ing and
        ahhh-ing at the right time and even believing the insipid
        dialog.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">After a challenging and
        great day we are sitting digesting our Thai dinner,
        writing our web entries and watching CNN. Just now in the
        Health and Science report this fun fact was revealed:
        &quot;gerbils recover from heart attacks more quickly if
        they consume moderate amounts of alcohol during their
        convalescence&quot;. I am ready to hit the hay and begin
        my own convalescence. It would be better if we could have
        found the beer at Wall Mart which we are a few too many
        feet from. There is the complaint for tomorrow that will
        deliver the free breakfast.</font></p>
