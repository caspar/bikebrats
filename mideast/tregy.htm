        Nile is Egypt and Egypt is the Nile&quot; Practically
        everyone we met told us this, incanting it like a mantra.
        --That was ten years ago, during my first and only other
        trip to Egypt, which was really just a long weekend in
        and around Cairo. It seems that this ancient adage still
        applies however, even in an Egypt hundreds of miles from
        the Nile. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Only ten kilometers of
        nasty Israeli coastline separated our beds in Eilat from
        the Egyptian border. Propelled by a killer tailwind, we
        were there in two shakes of a camel&#146;s tail. The exit
        process was precisely the same as the two that we had
        endured on our way to Jordan: lots of steps, lots of
        shekels to be dispensed, lots of suspicious, gun-toting
        teenage girls, lots of questions. We met two Italians
        coming the other way on a motorcycle. They informed us
        that the road ahead would be hilly but nicely-graded
        (&quot;Yeah, if you&#146;ve got 1000cc between your
        legs,&quot; I thought) and that the Egyptian authorities
        would demand a bribe, plus a lot of our time. It had cost
        them in excess of $400 to bring their motorcycle in, they
        explained. Groaning, we headed toward the massive
        building comprising the Egyptian customs and immigration.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">While the Italians had
        been correct about the amount of time it would take,
        crossing the border didn&#146;t cost us a dime. We
        entered the vast, empty hall and wandered about aimlessly
        for a while. The place was full of uniformed immigrations
        and customs inspectors, but they seemed to exist in
        another dimension, turning their heads away from us as we
        approached, and looking straight through us when we asked
        questions regarding the procedure. It was as if we were
        invisible. Only the money-changing guy seemed aware of
        our existence, when we started giving little kicks to the
        non-functioning ATM machine. &quot;There&#146;s another
        one at the Hilton,&quot; he informed us. He also pointed
        the way to the person in charge, a balding, rotund and
        self-important man who told us we couldn&#146;t obtain a
        visa for Egypt here. &quot;You mean you won&#146;t let us
        across?&quot; He shook his head and told us we could
        enter the Sinai without an Egyptian visa. &quot;But I
        thought the Sinai was in Egypt,&quot; I said, to which he
        responded with a blank look. How would we get to Luxor? I
        wondered. &quot;You can get a visa in Eilat,&quot; the
        man told us. But neither the thought of riding against
        the wind nor having evidence of my visit to Israel
        appealed to me. Besides, at the Egyptian embassy in Aqaba
        they told us we&#146;d be able to get visas at the
        border. When I asked if we could get one further down the
        road in Shar&#146;m El Sheikh, he said he wasn&#146;t
        sure. Reliable information was apparently a rare
        commodity in this country.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Fred and I had a brief
        consultation on the subject and decided to push our luck.
        At the very worst, we could take the boat from Nuweiba to
        Aqaba, an absurd idea, but feasible. Or maybe this was
        just a sign that we weren&#146;t meant to go all the way
        to Luxor, I thought aloud, having no idea that the worst
        massacre in the country&#146;s history was occurring at
        that very moment, in precisely the place we had chosen as
        our destination. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">There were still many
        formalities to take care of, but we only discovered these
        when we unknowingly broke the rules. The silent, laconic
        border guards, for instance, flew into a frenzy when we
        began pushing our bikes towards the exit. In irritated
        pantomime, they instructed us to put all of our
        possessions &#150;including the bikes&#151;through an
        x-ray machine. Somewhere during this process we
        encountered what appeared to be the only other traveler
        crossing into Egypt that day. A tall, skinny Brit, he was
        traveling on a moped, on his way to Eritrea and points
        east. Later, at Basata (where there are no secrets) we
        learned that this eccentric person was sponsored by
        Honda, and had already covered absurd amounts of distance
        on his little scooter. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Stopping to change money
        at the Taba Hilton --constructed by the Israelis when
        they controlled the Sinai and just meters from the
        border&#151;we ran into him again. He assumed we were
        stopping to spend the night, apparently having pegged us
        for the princessi that we are. No, I explained, we were
        pushing on, through the desert and hopefully to the Nile,
        to &quot;Egypt.&quot;</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Downtown Taba materialized
        only a couple of minutes&#146; pedal further, and while
        it may not be the real Egypt, we definitely weren&#146;t
        in Kansas anymore. The village consists of a ramshackle
        collection of cement structures organized around a
        central &quot;square&quot; filled with diseased-looking
        camels and randomly-strewn piles of garbage. It was
        already well past noon and we were hungry from all the
        strenuous immigration hassles, so we stopped at a gritty,
        fly-infested &quot;café.&quot; While a little brown boy
        assiduously attended to the task of grilling our chicken,
        we absorbed the ambiance. I thought how different this
        place was than Israel, and how we&#146;d be spending the
        better part of the following year in the developing
        world. After an interminable wait, the chicken finally
        appeared, and it turned out to be as delicious as it was
        cheap. &quot;I could get used to this,&quot; I thought to
        myself as we straddled our bikes once again, heading for
        the open road.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Alas, one more
        bureaucratic hurdle remained before we could plunge into
        the rugged countryside. A scruffy-looking guy holding a
        gate said we had to pay a tax to leave Taba, forcing us
        to retreat to a filthy cubbyhole on the main square,
        where another unsavory character lurked, shaking us down
        for five bucks apiece. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">A few pushes of the pedals
        put Taba behind us. Multihued faces of rock rose above us
        on our right side, while on the right the azure Gulf of
        Aqaba glistened invitingly. Parts of this pristine
        coastline were hideously marred by giant resorts under
        construction. I wondered who would ever fill these places
        up. Most Israelis would never consider vacationing in
        Sinai, and visitors from the rest of the world grow
        increasingly allergic to Egypt with each new terrorist
        attack. The whole thing smelt of a Mubarekian boondoggle.
        </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The supposedly flat road
        grew quite hilly. We played leapfrog with trucks for the
        rest of the day. They groaned slowly past us on the way
        up the steep slopes, and we&#146;d scream by them on the
        way back down. Predictably, our tailwind had shifted 180
        degrees, so even some of the downhills required
        straining. And the picture-perfect day had given way to
        brewing storm clouds. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The first big drops
        started falling just as we arrived at a place to stay on
        the beach, called Basata. From the road it looked like a
        godforsaken rathole, a random assembly of reed shacks on
        a rocky shingle. But for tonight it would have to do, the
        only shelter for miles around. A German woman &#150;whom
        we took for the manager&#151;showed us around the place
        while rattling off a long list of do&#146;s and
        dont&#146;s. Other guests were milling about the main
        &quot;building&quot;, where rain was already pouring in
        through the reed roof, looking miserable in the gathering
        darkness. Checking in at the same time as us were an odd
        trio of hippies: a young German girl called Verena; her
        Israeli admirer, Yaron; and a standoffish,
        head-in-the-clouds American trustafarian whom we called
        &quot;jingle belt&quot; for the string of bells she had
        tied around her bare midriff. We guessed correctly that
        they had met at the rainbow gathering up the road in Ein
        Yehov, and that Yaron had brought them here. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;It&#146;s the fifth
        hut down the beach, if you want to look at it,&quot; our
        hostess explained, noting that it might be a little wet
        inside, but that &quot;it never rains here, so it
        probably won&#146;t last.&quot; Our other option was to
        pitch our tent on the beach, which I thought would be
        drier. Fred&#146;s idea was to set up the tent inside the
        hut, making me wonder if the ride through the desert had
        baked his brain. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The hut itself was very
        simple indeed, just a bunch of reeds (obviously imported
        from an area of Egypt that had plants) tied loosely
        together and threatening to blow away in the increasingly
        blustery wind, a couple of mattresses without sheets, and
        a blanket for a door. No electricity, no running water,
        not even a window. I could feel Fred&#146;s dismay and
        promised we&#146;d only spend a night here, and would
        reward ourselves the next day with a &quot;princess
        fix&quot; at a glam resort. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">For want of activity and
        light, we headed back to the common hut and tried
        valiantly to play backgammon by the light of a single
        candle. Other guests &#150;primarily brooding
        Israelis&#151;lounged around and whispered
        conspiratorially, no doubt commenting on our
        inappropriateness. The place had the feeling of a
        meditation retreat, and we felt distinctly out of place.
        Dinner &#150;served family-style at a long, low table--
        helped us break the ice a little. Miraculously some
        electric lights came on, and we warmed up to a German
        family through playing with their two-year-old, Phillipe.
        Then an Arab with dazzling green eyes and an infectious
        smile appeared, decked out in a jelaba and a kefiya. His
        name was Sherif, whom we discovered the next day to be
        the owner of the place. Feeling a bit like intruders in
        an ashram, we slunk back to our hut not long after
        dinner, and sat in the damp, sand-blown darkness until
        beset by fatigue. </font></p>

    <tr>
        <td><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>17-23 November, Basata
        (a)</b></font><p><font size="2" face="Arial">We had every
        intention of pushing southwards the next day. I woke
        before sunrise and headed to the kitchen area for a
        do-it-yourself breakfast, competing with legions of
        flies. A couple of fresh-faced Americans were there with
        a much older chaperone. They said they were part of a
        program called &quot;semester at sea&quot;, that their
        ship was docked in Port Said, and that they&#146;d
        arrived in the middle of the night. Steve, with a long
        white beard, was their geography professor, and it was
        from him that we learned of the previous day&#146;s
        events at Luxor. &quot;But that&#146;s where we&#146;re
        headed,&quot; I told him. &quot;You might want to
        reconsider,&quot; came his grave reply. Coupled with my
        persistent sinus troubles (no doubt acquired in dusty
        Petra), this news caused me to reconsider: maybe we
        should stay an extra day or two. It certainly was
        refreshing to have some other Americans around to talk
        to, and to break up the somber Teutonic atmosphere of the
        place. When Fred showed up, I instructed him that we were
        staying an extra day, which didn&#146;t seem to bother
        him at all.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">It turned out to be a
        fantastic day, too. The snorkeling was superb; we
        yoga&#146;d on the beach with a couple of the young boat
        people (including the tall and charming Andy, for whom
        Fred fell like a stone in water); I dozed on our
        hut&#146;s verandah, and soon it was time for dinner. The
        staff had seen fit to stick all of the Americans
        together, and our loud talk drowned out even the
        Israelis. I couldn&#146;t remember the last time
        we&#146;d been able to speak pure and unfettered
        American, and their exuberance, their irreverence and
        lack of pretense was like finding water in the desert
        &#150;I couldn&#146;t get enough of it. They told us of
        their previous adventures in places like China and India,
        as well as the vicissitudes of life at sea with a few
        hundred hormonally-charged students. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Two days later, the
        Americans all had to be back on board their ship, yet we
        remained at Basata. The place had grown on us, and the
        unaccustomed rest felt heavenly. Each passing day melted
        serenely into the next. We&#146;d contemplate leaving
        every morning, then push our departure off until the
        afternoon, or the next day, or perhaps the day after
        that.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">A big part of what made us
        want to stay at Basata was the people we met there.
        Yaron, whom we steered clear of at first, fearing him
        overtalkative, revealed himself to be a charming and
        erudite fellow. He spoke a half dozen languages
        perfectly, and maintained a consistently positive
        attitude towards everything. Verena turned out to be
        pretty tolerable, too, in love with San Francisco and
        things American, while Jinglebelt remained curiously
        aloof, perhaps wanting to avoid her compatriots. After
        the American group left, we finally made inroads with the
        mysterious homo Egyptian couple, Yusef and Mahmoud. Yusef
        was from a wealthy Cairo family, yet even his fellow
        countrymen assume he&#146;s an outsider for his pink skin
        and yellow hair. Not quite albino, Yusef bears an
        astonishing resemblance to Harpo Marx, though he&#146;s
        far more articulate and cultivated. He has been involved
        with Mahmoud for over two years, but the two have yet to
        consummate their love for one another. Yusef says he
        doesn&#146;t want to press his handsome Nubian beloved
        into anything he didn&#146;t want to do. The whole
        arrangement reminded me of &quot;Ballad of the Sad
        Café.&quot;</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">When Yusef and Mahmoud
        invited us to join them on an excursion to Nuweiba to buy
        duty-free booze and swim with a tame dolphin, we agreed
        instantly. Not only would we get to see Nuweiba&#146;s
        dubious (and much-discussed at Basata) tourist
        attraction, we&#146;d also hopefully get a better glimpse
        into the weird workings of our Egyptian friends&#146;
        relationship. Besides, it was Fred&#146;s birthday, and
        maybe the duty-free shop would have champagne. After
        several delays, we all piled into Yusef&#146;s bright
        yellow car (to match his hair?) and headed southward.
        Mahmoud was at the wheel, swerving randomly from one lane
        to the other, at varying speeds. Fred and I kept looking
        at each other, silently praying that Yusef would drive on
        the way back. Up to that point, it was the longest and
        tensest 23 kilometers I&#146;d ever experienced in a car.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The duty-free shop was an
        ordeal, overseen by several fat bureaucrats who had a
        scam going wherein they only let you buy three of the
        alotted four bottles per person, so they could sneak the
        last one out and sell it on the black market. Our
        passports were perused &#150;and even
        stamped&#151;several times, and it took forever to
        calculate the bill. Yusef, indecisive on the bottles he
        wanted us to get for him, only complicated matters
        &#150;his modus operendi, it quickly became clear. In the
        end, what ought to have taken five minutes used up the
        better part of an hour, but everyone walked away
        satisfied. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Not so at the dolphin
        beach, where Fred said he&#146;d rather watch from land
        while we went swimming, at two bucks a head. The Bedouin
        selling tickets insisted that Fred pay as well, which
        sent Yusef into a frenzy. &quot;Would you have this man
        pay to look at the sun, the sky, things made by
        God?&quot; he asked, spitting lots more high-volume
        hyperbole in Arabic, and nearly coming to blows with the
        flustered ticket-seller. As the famous dolphin rolled
        languidly in the surf, Yusef drove us away in a huff, the
        rest of us laughing at the overly dramatic episode. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Yes, Yusef was behind the
        wheel now, causing me to revise my opinion of Mahmoud as
        the worst driver in Egypt. Yusef is quite simply the
        worst driver in the <u>world</u>. The road that led us to
        lunch was only a couple of kilometers long, but it took
        forever and was as much a white-knuckled ride as anything
        at Disneyland. He drove along at walking speed, sometimes
        slower, carrying on a conversation with us with us in the
        back seat, looking straight at us. We kept having to tell
        him to steer left or right in order to avoid careening
        into a ditch, another car, or a camel. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Lunch was another
        interminable affair, full of confusion and torpor on the
        service side. We drank some of the warm beers purchased
        duty-free, watched an adorable little boy play with a
        knife and then climb aboard a camel dozens of times his
        size, and waited for our food to appear. Afterwards, we
        made a shopping stop in a gritty tourist strip, where
        Mahmoud bought something or other while Yusef flirted
        shamelessly with a young Bedouin selling tacky souvenirs.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;Now let&#146;s go
        find some marijuana,&quot; announced Yusef, saying that
        he knew a Bedouin at a beach hotel who might have some.
        He drove through the parking lot and onto the beach to
        get to the place, causing some commotion among the staff.
        Fred wisely chose this moment to go for a walk on the
        beach while Mahmoud and I stood sheepishly beside Yusef,
        ranting on in Arabic. Again, we piled into the car, and,
        miraculously, our driver and host found his way to the
        road. His driving technique remained unchanged, and here
        on the highway passing trucks would lay on their horns in
        protest; but Yusef remained oblivious. At one point he
        was looking at the cliffs to our left, indicating them
        with both hands to Mahmoud and then stopping the car in
        the absolute center of the road. Fred looked at me,
        panic-stricken, and said, &quot;IDWD,&quot; meaning
        &quot;I don&#146;t wanna die.&quot; Moving again, he
        swerved without warning to the left, stopping in front of
        a concrete bunker-like structure advertising &quot;Camel
        Turst.&quot; Thinking it the ideal place to purchase some
        weed, he entered and asked around while the rest of us
        stayed near the car. Sure enough, a Bedouin guy popped
        out of the desert and provided Yusef with what he wanted.
        With about a thirty minute wait, it was by far the
        quickest transaction of the day.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">By some miracle we made it
        back to Basata in one piece. It was already getting dark.
        After hurriedly thanking our hosts, we hightailed it back
        to our shack for a little respite before dinner. Of
        course we&#146;d have to stay another day now, if only to
        recover from the drive back from Nuweiba.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Fred&#146;s birthday was a
        success. We shared our two bottles of champagne with
        everyone at dinner, and the cook had baked a huge,
        delicious cake. Yusef provided further party treats,
        which were enjoyed while sitting in a beached boat,
        looking up at the stars and listening to Mahmoud&#146;s
        fluid voice singing Nubian love songs.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">We met plenty of other
        people, too. Like the divorced and forty-ish Lindsay from
        England, there for six months on a sort of spiritual
        quest. Marianne was Danish and also divorced, after many
        years living in California with her American husband.
        Rounding out the trio of single ladies was a tall German
        woman with remarkable poise, visiting from Lucknow,
        India, where she has lived for many years on an ashram.
        Another German, York, was there with his hilarious
        Japanese fiancee, Kao-li. They met in Berkeley but were
        now living in Cairo, where York was studying Egyptian
        politics. We never did figure out the story of Dr. Ethan
        and his close friend, two older Israeli men who both had
        wives back in Tel Aviv, yet remained curiously intimate
        with each other. Then there were the French: adorable
        Alain was actually half-Egyptian, living in Cairo,
        disappointing Fred terribly when he began expressing an
        interest in the two German girls who manage Basata,
        Katherine and Caroline. Dodic and Daniele were a pair of
        older women from St. Malo, and had arrived directly from
        Luxor, where they had visited the &quot;temple of
        blood&quot; the day after the massacre. &quot;It was
        great,&quot; spouted Daniele, &quot;we had the whole
        place to ourselves. You should go too, you silly scared
        American. I mean, we&#146;ve all gotta die someday.&quot;
        I told her that I&#146;d prefer my death to be something
        other than being splattered over ancient columns and cut
        open like a fish, but she had planted a seed in my brain.
        Why couldn&#146;t we continue on to Luxor? Our family
        would kill us of course, but they didn&#146;t have to
        know.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Just when things had
        achieved a sort of stasis at Basata, falling comfortably
        into a slow, languid routine, Borg Hornemann showed up,
        right in the middle of dinner. Everyone was sitting
        crosslegged at the their respective tables, carrying on
        hushed conversations, when a man looking amazingly like
        Santa Claus (only wearing far fewer clothes) strode in
        and announced in his booming Danish voice: &quot;Hello,
        everyone, I am Hornyman.&quot; The guy was out of
        control, a font of useless information that he
        wasn&#146;t shy to share with you. But you couldn&#146;t
        help but admire his enthusiasm towards practically
        everything and everyone. You came across him everywhere
        &#150;on the way to the shower, out snorkeling on the
        reef, up on the hill people climbed to watch the
        sunset&#151; and once you engaged in conversation (more
        like a monologue, actually), he had you trapped there for
        at least forty-five minutes. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">It was tempting to stay on
        at Basata, but our bikes were beginning to look lonely
        all by themselves. After six nights in this magical
        place, we decided definitively to hit the road south, to
        Dahab, famous for hippies, diving and dope.</font></p>

        Basata to Dahab, 100km (f)</b></font><p><font size="2" face="Arial">Leaving Basata was as appealing to me as
        getting out of a sauna to roll around in the snow or
        crawling out from beneath the covers on a cold rainy day.
        It put everyone off their guard to see us carry our last
        bags over to our bikes in preparation for departure.
        Caroline and Catherine who managed Basata&#146;s guest
        relations nearly lost consciousness when we asked for a
        final accounting of what we owed. They&#146;d become
        accustomed to us beginning each day by asking sheepishly
        if we could rest another day at Basata. Today we were
        determined to continue our journey. It was a nearly
        tearful goodbye for us; we&#146;d bonded so with our
        hosts and the other guests. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Our departure was an
        especially difficult for Andy, who began his day by
        changing yet another tire. We finally pedaled onto the
        highway sometime after ten and were soon riding the two
        lane blacktop south to Dahab. Within few kilometers down
        the Sinai&#146;s coastal road --sandwiched between the
        crystal blue Red Sea and craggy exfoliated peaks-- we
        heard the horn of a Peugeot 505. The 505 is the preferred
        vehicle for service taxis that shuttle folks from place
        to place in the Sinai and operate like group shuttle
        services. One of our paranoid Israeli friends from Basata
        told us that they were all stolen from Israel, which made
        me wonder why I hadn&#146;t seen a single one north of
        the border.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">From within the passing
        cab Marianne and Lindsay (the Dane and Brit we spoke of
        in the last section) waved frenetically at us from inside
        the taxi on their way to embark upon their overnight
        camel trek. Later we learned that their taxi driver had
        taken an immediate liking to Marianne. He&#146;d popped
        Frank Sinatra into the tape deck to get her in the mood
        and began to fondle her knee just as soon as they entered
        the cab. We stopped to wish them a camelside bon voyage
        and witnessed Lindsay bonding with her mount as their
        Bedouin guides prepared for departure. Her camel moaned
        and bared its teeth each time it was burdened with a new
        package or parcel. We&#146;d decided that a group photo
        was in order and were surprised when Marianne&#146;s
        friend the taxi driver grabbed her and mugged for the
        camera instead of reaching for the camera to snap a shot
        for us. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Even with the stop it
        seemed like we reached Nuweiba faster by bike than by car
        with Yusef and Mahmoud a few days before. We zipped
        through the dirty sprawling port town without hesitation.
        Just as we were riding out of Nuweiba a grinning Northern
        European on Motor cycle zoomed up beside me. I looked at
        his motorized transport with disdain at first, but his
        smile won me over and we began to chatter with me about
        our respective trips. Mikko from Finland was on his way
        to Cairo and then further south into Africa. We stopped
        and took photos of one another before parting. Mikko
        validated my perception that the Finnish are among the
        kindest and coolest folks we&#146;d met on our trip.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Mikko was, however, not
        good enough to offer to tow us up one of the most vicious
        hills of our trip. Before us lay an 8% grade over 17
        kilometers. At the base of the hill a slow moving truck
        struggled to pass me. Just as I saw its taillights I
        thought to sprint up to it and get a tow up the hill but
        I glanced back and saw Andy pumping behind me and let it
        pass. Just after the truck&#146;s plume of smoke faded,
        Yusef and Mahmoud rode up next to us, honked, waved and
        parked their car in the shoulder on the incline.
        They&#146;d decided to wish us farewell once more.
        Mahmoud and Yusef jumped from their little yellow Fiat
        and walked back down the road towards us. At first I
        laughed and then scrambled for safety as I watched the
        little car roll down the hill in our direction. Mahmoud
        sprinted to the car and pulled the hand break just before
        it gained terminal velocity. We laughed together about
        our adventures and they were off to Cairo.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">A river of sweat poured
        off of me and I began to miss the comfort and convenience
        of Basata. My stomach churned for one of their lunch time
        fresh-baked vegetarian pizzas. Bob&#146;s Bedouin village
        popped into my line of vision as my stomach&#146;s
        growling began to drown out all other thought. At
        Bob&#146;s we snarfed a nutritious meal of soft drinks,
        cold water, potato chips and cookies. All the while yet
        another Middle Eastern kitty found a friend in Andy. This
        one had a taste for Andy&#146;s curry-chicken chips and
        ate more of them than we did. Refreshed and sated we were
        ready to venture onward. Bob counseled us on the terrain
        that lay ahead telling us that it was basically downhill
        all the way to Dahab from his perch at the top of the
        steep Wadi that led to the sea.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The remainder of the day
        was spent in a wide inland valley with abrupt walls
        formed by more decomposing granite. Marred only by the
        huge power poles that were being installed to supply
        electricity to the ugly resorts we&#146;d seen riding to
        Basata, the barren and largely pristine path was glorious
        -- no traffic, well paved, downhill, bright blue sky
        overhead. The only sound we heard for the next 40k was
        the wind through our hair and our tires whirring beneath
        the bikes.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">We arrived at the
        checkpoint outside of Dahab to find that this one was far
        better staffed than those a few days before near Basata.
        This left me wondering if the events at Luxor were making
        the Egyptians more security conscious. This time the
        soldiers actually stopped us and looked at our passports
        while their gun&#146;s bayonets gleamed in the afternoon
        sun. We were waved on and began the final descent into
        town. Only now our &quot;glorious&quot; downhill was now
        difficult to pedal for the huge headwind that met us. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The closer we got to Dahab
        the less appealing it looked. Its setting by the Red Sea
        is pretty enough, but the rampant construction of
        downmarket tourist traps made it all the less
        interesting. The first hotel we stopped at didn&#146;t
        help to make our impression of Dahab a positive one. Andy
        looked at a room, had been quoted a price and started the
        patented BikeBrats&#146; bargaining regime. &quot;Have a
        cyclists discount?&quot; he asked. The retort was swift
        and merciless: the clerk raised the price a few dollars.
        We left wandering into the Inmo Diving Center. We were
        quoted a fair price, shown a comfortable room and treated
        with respect and kindness by our hostess Ingrid.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">A few moments after
        checking in, Mohammed --Ingrid&#146;s husband-- greeted
        us warmly and offered to do anything he could to help us.
        It seems that Sharif from Basata had been there the night
        before and told them all about us. Mohammed helped us
        log-on to AOL to get our mail, invited us to dinner and
        made us feel at home. INgrid and MOhammed (get it? INMO
        diving center&#133;) run a first-class diving resort.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The town of Dahab itself
        is not exactly my tasse du thé. Restaurant after
        restaurant next to bar after bar line the waterfront walk
        where touts try to entice you into their establishments
        making a relaxing stroll along the coast less than. The
        one thing that all of these little places had going for
        them is that everyone had a backgammon board. We whiled
        away the night playing backgammon and drinking beer at a
        nearly empty place near our hotel. The funny thing about
        the tavern was that each time we&#146;d order a round, -a
        delivery boy would arrive from the market next door with
        two beers to replenish their stock. Sort of a just in
        time warehousing of beverages.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The next day we worked on
        our website, trying to finally finish Israel before going
        on to lower Egypt. We still didn&#146;t have a plan for
        how to get to the Nile and were facing increasing
        pressure from our friends and family not to go down to
        Luxor. We finally gave up the idea completely when
        inquiries about flights from Sh&#146;arm el Sheik to
        Luxor revealed that all had been cancelled. We were both
        disappointed but decided to push on down to Sh&#146;arm
        el Sheik anyway and then make our way back to Israel for
        the trip home.</font></p>

        and cranked our way up to the checkpoint to head south.
        From the start Andy was less than energetic. His cold had
        taken a toll on him and he was not well rested. About 15
        kilometers past the checkpoint we rounded a bend and met
        a sturdy head wind blowing constantly from the direction
        we were headed. Andy lagged behind and was clearly not up
        to going any further. He wanted to end our journey and
        made me promise not to blame him for turning around. I
        have to admit that I was a little relieved that he had
        given up. The idea of another 80 kilometers in the heat,
        against the wind only to arrive in an Egyptian version of

        arriving we&#146;d found a service cab, loaded the bikes
        on top and were motoring at a furious pace back to, where

        surprised to see us than we were to see Mohammed and
        Ingrid at Basata. They&#146;d decided that they needed a
        break from Inmo and that Basata was the place. They told
        us of the turmoil the massacre had caused, and how their
        conservative German clientele had canceled reservation
        after reservation. Mohammed was considering aloud what
        other business he could go into if he couldn&#146;t make
        ends meet at the resort. He was fearful for the future of
        his 65 employees and their families. It looked as though
        the terrorists in Luxor were having their way with the
        Egyptians.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Sharif, on the other end
        of the spectrum, was expecting a banner weekend. The
        American University of Cairo was celebrating Thanksgiving
        and was planning their annual Basata invasion. Luckily
        for us we&#146;d made a good impression on the fair folks
        there and they found the most luxurious hut on the
        property for us. Save Lindsay and Hornyman, all of our
        favorite guests had gone, and even they were ready to
        part company. The languid Egyptian youth, though
        something else to look at, were nowhere near as
        interesting as our other friends at Basata. Hornyman, not
        willing to go unnoticed went out with a bang. He paid a
        visit to the common area wearing only &quot;butt
        floss&quot; (a g-string) at the same time the Egyptian
        television station arrived to detail the problems the
        tourist industry was encountering post massacre. Imagine
        the fundamentalists&#146; dismay upon seeing Santa&#146;s
        full moon on national TV?! </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Thanksgiving was to be
        upon us within a few days and we&#146;d heard legend of
        some Americans coming to Basata from Cairo to celebrate.
        Connie Johnson was on her way and bringing a pack of
        friends and family. Andy and I were secretly planning an
        assault on their T-day gathering. Within a few hours of
        our arrival we&#146;d secured an invitation to their
        table and to share in their home made pecan pie for
        dessert. It took only a few sentences to find out that
        they were rabid Catholics; fortunately we didn&#146;t put
        our feet in our mouths. They had been to all of our
        pilgrimage points (save Notre Dame des Cyclistes) to
        commune with the Virgin as opposed to doubting her
        existence as we had.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">There was one truly tragic
        moment during our return to Basata. Our favorite
        two-year-old&#146;s mother and father were expecting a
        little brother or sister for Philippe. They were so happy
        to have a second and seemed to celebrate the upcoming
        event each day. There was a hushed atmosphere the day
        after thanksgiving, the family rushed off to Cairo
        cutting their vacation a few days short because the
        mother suffered a miscarriage. Everyone at Basata mourned
        for her loss. Another pair of unhappy campers turned up
        on our last night there. Phillipe and Kiki, from
        Brussels, appeared at our dinner table looking a bit
        shell-shocked. They had come up from Luxor and had been
        at the temple during the massacre. Fortunately for them,
        they had gotten an early start and were in the upper
        reaches of the site when the shooting began, en route to
        the Valley of Kings. From their hiding place behind a
        rock, they heard the shots and screams that lasted over
        an hour. To add insult to injury, their charter flight
        back to Europe was cancelled (since no flights were
        coming in), forcing them to find another way back home.
        My guess is that they&#146;ll be taking their next
        vacation in Switzerland, or maybe Luxembourg. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Our last day at Basata was
        a fine one, snorkeling in the coral reefs with Lindsay,
        munching one last lunchtime pizza and relaxing at night
        playing backgammon and drinking scotch. We&#146;d slipped
        into the easy pattern again and the momentum to leave was
        not there. Somehow we overcame the gravity that pulls you
        into a most relaxed state and headed by service taxi to
        the border.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>Heading stateside (f)</b></font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Once back in Eilat we
        paused amongst the Russian tourists only long enough to
        grab a bus ticket and lunch. We made it to Tel Aviv that
        night in the company of two fellow Basata guests. They
        were darling girls, really charming, but clearly had an
        agenda to get us to their house and hog-tie us. We had to
        graciously refuse their hospitality and arrange to get
        the heck out of the mid east. We both were bitten with a
        fever to get home. Arriving in Tel Aviv, we ran into our
        stinky but cute friend Matthieu (from Petra) on his way
        home for a shower after work washing dishes. The next day
        we rendezvoused with the Rotbards again for a scrumptious
        Indian dinner, where young Adam practically passed out in
        his chicken tikka. It was a school night and way past his
        bedtime. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">A number of options lay
        before us. One &#150; we could take the Nissos Kypros
        back to Athens and fly on our existing reservation. Two -
        fly directly from Tel Aviv to New York. Three - fly to
        Athens. We decided on the last because it would be the
        simplest logistic and the cheapest option. The one thing
        neither of us will ever forget is our interrogation at
        the Tel Aviv Airport. The agents separated us and quizzed
        us about every detail of our journey. Finally we proved
        everything by giving them a tour of the website and they
        waved scanning our bags in the xray machine. Within 36
        hours of arriving in Tel Aviv, we were on our flight and
        headed back to the States. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">At the airport in Athens
        neither of us was very surprised to find that the Greeks
        wouldn&#146;t be able to get our baggage onto our Delta
        flight in time. When we arrived in NYC we turned this
        misfortune to our advantage. We had Delta deliver the
        bikes and our bulky bags directly to Phoenix where we
        planned to stage the next segments of our journey.</font></p>
