        </strong></em>The relaxed weekend at the beach that we
        had envisioned as our reward for pedaling so hard through
        Florida (&quot;the Redneck State&#146;) was not meant to
        be. All of the hotels in and around Jacksonville Beach
        were booked by prom-goers, softball clubs and fraternity
        parties, so we were sent packing after our brief one
        night stay at the beach. We did make it down to Saint
        Augustine in friend Randy&#146;s veryfast car. I was
        curious to see our intended destination and what is
        billed as &quot;America&#146;s oldest city.&quot;
        Unfortunately, what remains of the historic old town has
        been all but obscured by a barrage of tourist hype. The
        &quot;oldest schoolhouse&quot; houses a gift shop. The
        &quot;oldest courthouse&quot; is now a Ripley&#146;s
        Believe-it-or-not Museum. Talent-free musicians pollute
        the streets, and busloads of tourists search for bargain
        souvenirs.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">We ended up spending that
        night in downtown Jacksonville, where I watched to sun
        set over the St. Somethingorother River. Since it was
        Saturday night, I felt obliged to check out the queer
        scene, and took a cab to a club called &quot;3D.&quot; It
        was a cavernous and empty place, but soon I was talking
        to a guy called Patrick, a white schoolteacher who taught
        African-American history to black students. I thought he
        might be able to enlighten me as to the thought processes
        of rednecks. &quot;What makes them so mean?&quot; I
        asked, but the best response Patrick could come up with
        was &quot;That&#146;s just the way they are.&quot; More
        edifying was my conversation with a boy who insisted I
        call him Thumper, even though everyone else called him
        Richard. He was 21 and had an eight-year-old daughter
        living somewhere with her mother. It seems Thumper
        married at age 12 a woman seven years his senior after
        making her pregnant. They split up when his wife caught
        him in flagrante delicto with her brother &#150;a
        Southern story if there ever was one.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><em><strong>Savannah<br>
        </strong></em>Savannah was an interesting place, with an
        amazingly elegant and timeless town center. Our first
        evening there we went to a highly segregated queer bar,
        where we treated to a rather pathetic little drag show,
        after which I continued my investigations into redneck
        culture. I met a couple at the bar who introduced me to a
        kind of whiskey called &quot;blend.&quot; Both of them
        managed restaurants in town and had grown up in redneck
        families. They said that rednecks made excellent lovers,
        which would surprise me, and were actually rather sweet,
        given the right circumstances. I think they wanted me to
        discover this for myself, but I graciously turned down
        their offer. When I started to talk to Garrick, a black
        boy who had just moved there from Colombia (in one of the
        Carolinas, I think) to manage a BP station. He said he
        thought that the people of Savannah were mean, but
        didn&#146;t elaborate. I think it made him nervous
        talking to a white boy in front of his friends.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The next day we walked
        around the many squares that characterize Savannah,
        marveling at the old live oaks dripping with Spanish moss
        and the carefully restored homes. We stumbled upon Clint
        Eastwood and his production crew, on their first
        day&#146;s on-location shoot of &quot;Midnight in the
        Garden of Good and Evil&quot;, based on the book that
        inspired our visit. Clint looked pretty haggard, wrinkled
        and skinny and I wondered how anyone could still consider
        him a sex symbol.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><em><strong>Atlanta<br>
        </strong></em>The trip on to Atlanta went by quickly with
        Fred driving our $10-a-day Taurus. I entertained myself
        with the GPS system, which helped us find Pat&#146;s
        house. Pat &#150;formerly known as &quot;Aunt
        Pat&quot;&#151;is an old friend of my family&#146;s, a
        connection which Fred and I exploited in order to get a
        dose of homier living. Her house provided a great staging
        ground for our departure for Europe, and her hospitality
        was unsurpassed. She even provided us entree into
        Atlanta&#146;s bewildering homo scene by way of her
        dentist friend, Dr. Dick. At Blake&#146;s bar, where we
        went no fewer than three times, we felt underdressed in
        jeans. Everyone had that over-groomed,
        just-out-of-the-shower look and I suspected that most of
        them vote Republican.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">For my birthday Fred got
        me a haircut at a fabulously chi-chi salon, where the
        ultra-glam receptionist gave me a tour before sheparding
        me to my chair. I also got new biking gloves and a
        glittery blue saddle, purchased from a dyed-and-tatooed
        poser called Booger. We also gorged ourselves in upscale
        eateries like Annie&#146;s Thai Kitchen, Indigo, and
        Zocalo, where the host&#146;s welcome was especially
        warm. An unexpected surprise came when I was able to cash
        in our tickets to Europe and use a free companion coupon,
        saving us enough bucks for two extra weeks on the
        road&#133;</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">At the airport we were
        pleasantly surprised by the service of Delta&#146;s
        counter staff. The Japanese woman (Komiko?) who weighed
        our bags (more than 60 pounds each of gear, not counting
        the bikes or our handlebar bags) was very funny, and
        waived the fee for the bike boxes. A friendly homo
        &#150;whose name unfortunately escapes us now&#151;
        helped us box the bikes and scored us some seats on the
        full flight. Once in the air, I could only think of
        getting out of the claustrophobic plane and back into
        breathable air. Our fellow passengers seemed to consist
        entirely of retired American package tourists and loud
        and smelly Spaniards. I didn&#146;t manage to sleep at
        all, and felt like hell when we finally made it to
        Barcelona.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><em><strong>Barcelona<br>
        </strong></em>We thought we&#146;d ride into town from
        the airport, but by the time we had assembled our bikes,
        it was raining pretty hard. Plus we learned that the
        safest way into town was via the freeway, and that there
        was a train; so much for integrity&#133; As we pushed our
        bikes up the escalators and out of the train station in
        central Barcelona, people waved at us and gave us
        thumbs-up signs. The traffic on the streets to our hotel
        was horrendous, but I never felt threatened, and the
        hotel staff went out of their way to accommodate our
        bikes. After a shower and a delicious lunch (though Fred
        mistakenly ordered tripe and pouted through that part of
        the meal), we were liking Europe. It definitely felt
        different from the vast spaces of the US, especially in
        the cramped alleyways of the Barri Gotic, where we were
        staying. We wandered around for a while and took a
        coma-like nap before checking out the rather miserable
        Monday evening homo scene. The first place we deemed
        worthy of a stop was called &quot;La Concha&quot;, its
        walls covered with photos of Barcelonian singer/actress
        Sara Montiel. In another bar that doubled as a queer
        youth center, we met Gino from Uruguay (whose card
        vaguely states &quot;show businéss&quot;) and young
        Malik from Calais, in France, who moved to Barcelona to
        work in a bagel shop. We poked our noses into a few other
        places, but they were absolutely void of life, so we
        opted for dinner in a lively tapas bar before hitting the
        hay. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The next morning at
        breakfast we met a trio of American homos from Tampa, and
        then ran into them later on the roof of Gaudi-designed La
        Pedrera, where they invited us to have dinner with them
        later. Fred and I went on to visit Gaudi&#146;s
        yet-unfinished masterpiece, the Sagrada Familia temple.
        Climbing the stairs we ran into a couple of cuties from
        Emory college in Atlanta who recognized us from the plane
        (I hadn&#146;t noticed anyone under forty) who deemed our
        project officially crazy. Over lunch in another tapas bar
        we talked to an Italian named Lorenzo, who works for a
        network marketing company and tried pushing his product
        on us.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Manuel, David and Newton
        made excellent dinner companions. Manny is a Cuban-born
        pediatrician, and Newton is his cute and subtly
        outrageous student boyfriend. They had tons of energy and
        stories, while their vegetarian bachelor friend David was
        more phlegmatic. We took them to La Concha to show them
        the Sara Montiel shrine, and then called it a night,
        since they had a plane to catch the next morning and we
        were planning to hop on a train.</font></p>

        to Fontllonga, 64K</b></font><p><font size="2" face="Arial">After spending nearly 10 days off our bikes
        I was ready to get moving even though the time spent in
        Atlanta and Barcelona was far from restful. The night
        before our departure from Barcelona was no exception.
        Andrew&#146;s sore throat had him tossing and turning and
        the excitement of finally getting underway kept me awake
        as well. <i>(In Andy&#146;s case it might not be his sore
        throat that kept him from sleeping as he said. My
        personal theory is that he is having troubles resting
        because of the guilt of knowing that he is in violation
        of the two underwear rule. Since our trip to New York he
        has had as many as four pair after &quot;mistakenly&quot;
        taking two extra pair from there. He is only one pair
        over limit after having given me a pair when one of my
        two pair failed &#150; Calvin Kleins are not meeting the
        BikeBrats test)</i></font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">We had the choice of
        taking a train at either eight or twelve. The choice was
        obvious and we rode to the station after a leisurely
        breakfast. <i>(&quot;Why are the BikeBrats taking a
        train?,&quot; you might ask. Have we become the
        TrainBrats? No, we have not changed our mode of
        transportation, only our mindset. The US portion of our
        trip was intended to be pure. We were to ride every mile
        crossing the states using only pedal power. After the
        U.S. we always intended to use alternative forms of
        transportation when necessary or desirable. Riding across
        the Atlantic did not seem very practical, so we flew.
        Riding in and out of big urban areas exposed us to the
        most dangerous and unrewarding experiences so we decided
        to start our voyage in Europe in the countryside of
        Spain.)</i> The ride to the station was shockingly
        painless. The Barcelonans were as easy going behind the
        wheel as they were in person. There were no mishaps,
        confrontations, disasters or, for that matter, any
        occurrences worth noting on the way to the station which
        made me question our reasoning for taking a train in the
        first place. The drivers gave us lots of room, were very
        courteous and aware of our presence. At the station we
        got our tickets and picked up some cash and waited at the
        platform for our first &quot;cheating&quot; of the trip.
        As I walked through the terminal it was hard not to
        notice the Mormon Elders arriving fresh from the US for
        their mission in Spain. They all had shiny new suits,
        name tags, fresh haircuts and that &quot;I just
        can&#146;t wait to have three wives&quot; look.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">At the platform we were
        waiting at the wrong end and had to dash madly to the
        other end of the train in order to board our bikes.
        Getting the 90+ pound devils onto a train is a bit of
        work in of itself but it was further complicated by a
        goofy Spanish passenger. The conductor had instructed us
        to go to the last car and put our bikes on there. We were
        about the only folks around on that part of the train. In
        the doorway of the last car there were eight folding
        seats. Our plan was to put our bikes in this area and
        hang out with them on two of the seats. The only
        &quot;fly in the ointment&quot; was the passenger who had
        his heart set on sitting in this area of all places on
        this empty train. It made it very hard to find a place
        for ourselves and our bikes. Finally the conductor came
        through and told us where to put the bikes with or
        without the cooperation of the fool who scowled as we
        followed the conductor&#146;s instructions. He exited at
        the first stop, freeing us to have our way with our
        bikes. This turned out to be the only difficult Spanish
        person we&#146;d met so far.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Upon arrival in Lleida we
        had a quick snack and hopped on our bikes and pedaled
        into the countryside and were on our way to the Pyrenees.
        Ancient farm ruins dotted the roadside as we road through
        the arid foothills. The pavement itself was rough but not
        very trafficked and the foliage and scenery were amazing.
        Wildflowers &#150;including millions of red poppies--
        carpeted the shoulders. We climbed gradually, passing
        through picturesque villages surrounding classic European
        central squares housing cafés and churches. Our route
        began to follow the Noguera River up into the foothills,
        where a system of hydroelectric dams have formed a chain
        of lakes along our route. The green waters of the Noguera
        dumped into the lakes rendering an unforgetable emerald
        color. The day&#146;s long steep climbs rewarded us with
        panoramic views of the lakes and mountains that were
        truly spectacular.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">After 60k, a few steep
        climbs, little sleep and a long train ride we were ready
        to stop. Miraculously we came upon a hotel in the middle
        of nowhere that had rooms looking down upon the verdant
        hillside and green pool below. We both felt wimpy for not
        having ridden further but were happy to stop at such a
        beautiful spot. The restaurant of the hotel provided some
        entertainment. So unaccustomed to entertaining guests
        they hadn&#146;t prepared a menu. Compounding the
        confusion was our waitress&#146; horrible English which
        she insisted on practicing on us. We couldn&#146;t get
        her to explain anything in Spanish so it took us nearly
        thirty minutes just to order. In the end it was worth it;
        we had our first of many copiously huge Spanish
        countryside meals and went to bed full of the sights,
        smells and tastes of Spain.</font></p>

        with the sun shining through the window and eight hours
        of deepest sleep under my belt, I had difficulties
        getting out of bed this morning. Hoping my sore throat
        and general lack of energy wouldn&#146;t impede my
        riding, I dragged my ass out of bed and went directly in
        search of coffee. It was surprising to find the
        restaurant/bar so active, considering that we were the
        only guests in our unfinished, isolated hotel. We quickly
        noted that all of the other patrons were male (where do
        the Spaniards hide their womanfolk?) and that we were the
        only ones not drinking beer.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Just as we were about to
        hit the road, we met a fellow cycle tourist heading in
        the opposite direction. He was a Dutch guy with an
        impossible-to-pronounce name, on his way from Toulouse to
        Lisbon. We went through the usual mutual butt-sniff and I
        was pleased by his admiration of our equipment.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">A few miles down the pike
        the road penetrated the Portell dels Terredets, where
        huge granite cliffs rise several hundred meters straight
        up from the riverbed. When we emerged we were greeted
        with an entirely different view: before us lay a vast
        green valley, and for the first time, the snow-capped
        peaks of the Pyrenees were visible in the distance. It
        wasn&#146;t long before we found ourselves in the
        valley&#146;s capital, a jarringly bustling town called
        Tremp, where we stopped for coffee and oranges and put on
        rain gear. Alas, our sunny day had disintegrated once
        again into rain. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Lunch was a few kilometers
        further uphill, in another busy town called la Pobla de
        Segur. We ate in what may have been the town&#146;s only
        proper restaurant open for lunch, and were bewildered by
        all the bottles set out on the other tables. Their
        presence soon became apparent, however, when a huge group
        of highway workers came in. On one side of us was a table
        of four consisting of two young yuppie-esque engineers
        who obviously came from the city and who didn&#146;t seem
        too pleased by their posting in the mountains, along with
        two grubbier dudes who were presumably their foremen. On
        our other side was a table of ten workers who got
        progressively more drunk throughout the many-coursed
        meal. My attention was diverted from this entertaining
        spectacle, though, by another group across the dining
        room who were passing around a sort of glass wineskin. I
        asked them what it was and the answer was something like
        &quot;porra.&quot; Among these men was the
        establishment&#146;s owneer, who explained to me that it
        was &quot;tipicamente catalan&quot; and enabled its user
        to get drunker quicker since the wine goes straight from
        the vessel to the gullet. After demonstrating the use of
        this device, he insisted that I try, and when I managed
        to get a drink with only a few dribblings on my chin,
        what sounded like the entire clientele of the restaurant
        burst into admirative applause. A woman who worked there
        began laughing more loudly than I&#146;ve ever heard
        anyone laugh; it sounded like the braying of the donkey.
        The owner told me that she too was &quot;tipcamente
        catalana.&quot; When I said she sounded more like a burro
        than a mujer, he started laughing too. We could still
        hear her as we pedalled our way out of town. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Even though the weather
        still sucked, the scenery continued to be awesome. We
        passed through a series of deeply-cut gorges, the most
        impressive being the &quot;Desfiladero de Collegats&quot;
        and the river turned from tranquil green to gushing
        white. Throughout most of this section of the journey we
        had the old road along the river to ourselves, since the
        auto traffic was diverted through newly cut tunnels,
        built by none other than our luncheon neighbors. We
        recognized some of them &#150;including the drunk guy
        with a huge bandage over an eye&#151;and they waved at us
        as we passed by in the rain. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">In Sort we made another
        coffee/hot chocolate stop. Next to us workers were
        putting the final touches on what will soon be an
        Internet café (had it been completed, we would have
        popped in and bookmarked our site on every machine, as we
        have in other places). We were planning to ride as high
        as we could in order to make tomorrow&#146;s ride easier,
        but only made it four kilometers to the next village,
        where a posh-looking place tempted us to get out of the
        rain. I made the mistake of opting for full pension,
        since it trapped us into dining with two huge groups
        passing through the valley in buses. After a glorious
        sauna, swim and siesta, we hit the dining room &#150;a
        cavernous, utilitarian sort of place filled with the
        screams of hundreds of hyper schoolchildren getting a
        dose of the great outdoors and the sputtering of hundreds
        more elderly peasant folk on their way to Lourdes. The
        whole experience felt like an updated chapter from
        &quot;Canterbury Tales.&quot; Both groups were weary
        pilgrims who had stopped (presumably with reservations)
        at a roadside inn, where the innkeepers worked
        desperately to maintain a thin veil of respectability
        over their operation. The food could only be described as
        &quot;institutional&quot;, with the chef&#146;s resume
        almost certainly including some prison experience, yet
        the tuxedoed maitre d&#146; was positively obsequious,
        seemingly oblivious to the bedlam all around him. It was
        if he fancied himself overseeing a first-class resort at
        Gstaad or something. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Afterwards, while my
        stomach tried to digest the evil lump that had been
        dinner, I channel-surfed, and was delighted to stumble
        upon the &quot;X Files&quot;, though the Spanish woman
        who dubs Skully makes her sound like a gasping bimbo. It
        made me think of my friend Georges in Paris who does the
        voice for Mulder, and how I&#146;d be in my former
        homeland in just a couple of days.</font></p>

        Vielha, 77km</b></font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Our day began at three in
        the morning as the children staying at our summer
        camp/hotel ran down the hallways thumping on doors and
        shouting. We somehow managed to get some sleep after
        that, but we were both still suffering from our colds and
        the night was again not very restful. The children had
        cleared out before we went to breakfast but their stay
        was in evidence. All of the doors to their rooms were
        open and the maids were trying to undo some of their
        damage. In their rooms furniture was scattered, trash was
        strewn upon the floors and drapes were pulled down from
        their curtain rods.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Breakfast was even more
        uninspired than dinner the night before. Cellophane
        wrapped pastries, canned fruit, toast and yogurt were all
        they had to offer. We discovered that teens were not the
        only loud Spaniards. The aging Spanish tourists who had
        been bussed in were shouting at one another at the tables
        adjacent to ours so loudly we could hardly hold a
        conversation. When we suggested to our waitress that
        things should be calmer with the children gone she
        laughed rolled her eyes and gestured towards the
        &quot;children that still remain&quot; meaning the old
        folks in the dining area.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Starting the day riding
        was difficult knowing what was in store for us. We knew
        that after lunch the gradual uphill would turn sharply
        more steep and that we&#146;d spend over 20 kilometers
        climbing the last 1200 meters to the summit. Regardless
        of the work that lay ahead of us and the heavy weather we
        started off and were rewarded with more dramatic scenery
        in the gorges of the Noguera. The treacherously deep and
        unstable canyon wreaked havoc on the roads in some
        places, so the roads were replaced by tunnels. Luckily
        the old roads still ran along the river and were reserved
        for use by pedestrians, cyclists and horse carts and they
        treated us to spectacular views and uncrowded passage. So
        distracting, the scenery caused Andrew to miss seeing a
        Volkswagen-sized boulder on the road and he hit it
        squarely, bending his front rim. It was damaged enough to
        cause an annoying noise but not enough to end our trip.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The cool damp day consumed
        my energy and we had to stop frequently for hot beverages
        to maintain energy. After one of those stops we saw the
        hundred teenagers from our hotel suiting up on the
        riverbank for a whitewater rafting trip. I was jealous of
        them, recalling that I had never had a field trip from
        school so interesting. The air went from being damp to
        outright precipitating on us off and on as we ascended. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The light rain subsided as
        we began the steep part of our ascent and we knocked off
        the first two kilometers of the climb before stopping for
        lunch. Lunch was another huge midday meal, this time
        exquisitely presented. The main course of lamb chops was
        served on a sizzling slab of slate resting on fresh pine
        branches. With our tummies full of sheep we hit the
        trail, we had 1000 meters more to climb before our day
        would end. Speaking of sheep, we came across one that had
        been hit by a car just as a motorist stopped to take it
        from the road. Couldn&#146;t help thinking that it would
        make great chops.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The road was impressive,
        very well graded with a fine surface passing through
        lovely terrain. Every direction we looked we were
        distracted by something. Trees, the gorge, snow capped
        mountains and falls all kept us from thinking about the
        3000 foot ascent we were subjecting our legs to. The
        clouds began to thicken as a restaurant/bar and shrine we
        had been told of came into view. As we approached it the
        rain fell lightly on us. I was looking forward to getting
        something warm in my stomach and out of the rain for a
        few moments when we discovered that the establishment was
        closed for holidays. Just as we were about to get back on
        our bikes Paul and Breda appeared from nowhere.
        Apparently they had been riding the same route as we had
        this day. They are an Irish couple spending their
        holidays riding the Pyrenees for three weeks.
        Breda&#146;s saddle looked a little sad so I gave here my
        old one that I had kept after installing a new softer one
        the day before. We shared a snack and some conversation
        until we noticed that big black and mean clouds were
        descending upon us. We had 300 meters more to climb and
        decided to do them before it rained. We spent the next
        minutes watching the intrepid couples&#146; behinds as
        they cranked up the hill ahead of us. Just as we made the
        pass the sky began to open up and dump cold rain on us.
        There was no shelter to be had as the restaurant there
        was closed like the last one. We put on our rain gear and
        rolled down the other side of the mountain. Even with the
        wet weather it was glorious if not bone chilling. After
        whipping down the road for 30 minutes we had eaten up 23K
        of road past countless little ski villages and made it to
        Vielha which was the final destination of the day for
        Paul and Breda. After a little convincing Andy agreed to
        call it a day there too.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">We dined with Paul and
        Breda, who told us about the sorry state of marriage in
        Ireland. Divorce was just legalized a few months ago and
        can only be granted after five years of separation. To
        keep things from getting complicated none of the young
        marry. The church and religion were the &quot;whipping
        boys&quot; of our dinner and provided us with endless
        laughs. After our meal we went in search of a whisky,
        stumbling into a hooker bar accidentally. The regulars
        were wearing nothing but underwear, garter belts and
        bustiers. A little too racy for us, so we found a place
        on the central square and had a cocktail outside, the air
        having become surprisingly balmy.</font></p>

        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">At breakfast we learned
        more about the Catholic church&#146;s stranglehold over
        Ireland from Breda and Paul. Abortion being illegal on
        the Emerald Isle, many women are forced to travel to
        England for the procedure. Ireland wanted to make this
        illegal as well, and were only stopped by their
        constitution. Paul also told us about being a fireman in
        Dublin, and how his job mostly involved paramedic work.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Reluctantly, we hit the
        road well past ten in the morning. Big drops fell
        intermittently from the sky and Fred was tempted to stay
        another day in Spain. I told him it was all downhill to
        France, though, and soon we were screaming down the
        uppermost reaches of the Garonne/Garona river, which
        flows all the way to Bordeaux. The sun even appeared for
        a while to re-energize us. The border was marked by an
        enormous grocery store, where I insisted we stop to spend
        our last pesetas. Inside, all of the customers were
        French, taking advantage of Spain&#146;s lower sales tax.
        The most popular item by far was Pastis 51; the guy
        checking out in front of me had over ten bottles of the
        stuff. I stuck with staples, though: water, oranges,
        chocolate, gum, and a Pez dispenser for Fred.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The mountain villages of
        France looked distinctly different from those we saw in
        Spain. While Spain&#146;s villages had been compact,
        colorful and lively, the first villages and towns we
        pedalled through in France were deserted, randomly
        organized, gray and shabby-looking. We stopped in one
        such place called Saint Béat for lunch in a bar.
        Realizing we had no cash, we asked the inbred-looking
        barman where the nearest AT M was, and it turned out to
        be a woman in a hardware store overseeing a drawer full
        of cash. The meal was copious and uninspired, served by
        an impertinent, ill-mannered young girl. And the coffee
        was undrinkable. I told myself and Fred that we could
        stop in one of the next villages for coffee.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">But there was no coffee to
        be found. We rode through village after village and none
        of them seemed to have a café. Where we really in
        France? I had read somewhere that the Pyrenees was one of
        the poorest regions in the country and that many people
        had deserted the countryside for the towns. It reminded
        me of Auvergne, another gorgeous mountainous part of
        France we&#146;ve cycled through which had a dearth of
        cafés. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Near the village of
        Izaourt, we turned off the main road onto a narrow,
        rolling, winding affair that was the quintessence of the
        cycling nirvana I associate with France. It took us
        through and around villages, meadows and woods, vaguely
        following the valley of the Neste river. Rain made us
        stop in la Barthe-de-Neste, where we found shelter under
        some old arcades. Alas, there was no café to be found,
        but we did find an old guy who ran a little auberge who
        said he could make us a pot of coffee. He watched soccer
        in the adjoining room while we read the paper and pet his
        crippled old cat. &quot;She&#146;s fifteen years
        old,&quot; the old man explained, &quot;and she has a
        sore back.&quot; He went on to tell us that the locals
        were very appreciative of the rain, since they had been
        experiencing a drought since February. The unseasonably
        hot temperatures had made everything bloom six to eight
        weeks early. He brought us out a bowl of cherries as if
        to prove this, though I still had a hard time believing
        him while shivering in the cold rain. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Finally, we gathered up
        the courage to go back out into the stuff, putting on our
        dorky-looking rain pants for the seven-kilometer ride to
        the nearest town with a train station, where we figured
        we&#146;d choo-choo into Tarbes. Once at the station,
        however, we learned that the SNCF was on strike (yes, we
        were definitely in France now) and that no trains were
        running from there neither that day nor the next. We were
        told to try another town further down the road; maybe
        there would be trains there. With black clouds on the
        horizon and frequent thunderclaps, we wondered if
        we&#146;d make it before getting dumped on. And for a
        while I thought we would. The road was a dream: sixteen
        kilometers of steady downhill through lush forest. But by
        the time we made it to the bottom it was pouring. And the
        stationmaster at Tournay sang us the same song: no trains
        today. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">But Tarbes was only twenty
        kilometers further, and the rain did seem to be letting
        up, so we decided to push for our original goal, where
        the Spartacus guide promised a queer restaurant called
        &quot;L&#146;Opera des Hommes&quot; which turned into a
        disco on Saturday night. It was a tough twenty km,
        though, including a seemingly endless gradual uphill. For
        the first time since leaving San Diego, we resorted to
        the emergency packets of GU we had brought along &#150;a
        sticky sugary substance designed to provide athletes with
        energy. I told Fred I&#146;d never considered myself an
        athlete, and nearly gagged on the stuff. It didn&#146;t
        seem to help much either, though we did make it to
        Tarbes, cranky, hungry and totally exhausted from the
        day&#146;s long ride. The town was grey and ugly, with an
        annoying dearth of places to stay. We ended up at the
        &quot;Hotel des Touristes&quot;, with a tiny
        claustrophobic room up five flights of stairs. The beds
        were predictably awful, with the mysterious &quot;penis
        pillows&quot; that are so ubiquitous in the French
        countryside. Yes, we had made it to France, and I
        wasn&#146;t so sure I was happy about it.</font></p>

        on the central square in Tarbes validated that it was a
        ghastly town. The center is dominated by an enormous
        parking lot, which played host to a flea market on this
        sunny Saturday. Townspeople picked among the cheap goods
        as we had a coffee and digested a few pastries.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The best thing about
        Tarbes was the road out of there. It was wide with a
        shoulder that became a dedicated bike lane. As we made
        our pilgrimage to Lourdes, bicycle clubs out for a Sunday
        ride passed us in the other direction and ignored our
        waves and greetings. It was not until we rang our bells
        that we got some reaction from our fellow bikers. The sun
        warmed us, I&#146;d forgotten what it was like to ride
        under ideal conditions and was thankful for the reminder
        that cycling could be an unqualified joy.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Soon we rolled into the
        McDonald&#146;s of religious experiences. When I saw a
        roadside sign advertising the fast food
        establishment&#146;s downtown Lourdes branch I suggested
        we pop in for a McMiracle. Tempting as it was, we avoided
        McDo&#146;s once again and headed for the grotto after a
        quick pizza lunch. The road that winds down the hill to
        Bernadette&#146;s folly is inundated with souvenir stores
        hawking only postcards and Mary-shaped vessels to hold
        the sacred water from the shrine.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">If you know the story of
        Lourdes, are religious or believe in Mary you can skip
        this paragraph. Lourdes is famous because this loony
        little girl named Bernadette imagined she saw Mary in
        this grotto by the river where the townspeople threw
        their trash. She began to go there every day, continuing
        to see the countenance of Mary. She told others about it.
        Rumors spread and folks started coming from surrounding
        villages to gawk at Bernadette having hallucinations. The
        townspeople got mad and the local law enforcement began
        to hassle Bernie. Then she really lost it and began to
        rub dirt and trash on herself while talking to Mary.
        Somehow while she was digging around in the rubbish she
        accidentally discovered a spring in the trash grotto
        (Miracle one). A little bit later Mary appeared and told
        here that she was &quot;the immaculate conception.&quot;
        This turned out to be important to the Catholics who were
        looking for some way to figure out how Mary&#146;s birth
        could be virginal in addition to Jesus&#146; (Miracle
        two). Mary told Bernie a little later that folks should
        come to Lourdes as their pilgrimage and that the water
        was healing (Miracle three &#150; the most profitable
        one, and the reason they did not throw her into the loony
        bin, Bernie becomes a marketeer for the church). </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Six million suckers a year
        come to Lourdes. Enough to justify an international
        airport that sports direct flights from places like
        Ireland. There is even a TGV (very fast) train from Paris
        that stops just a few hundred meters from the hoax. Many
        may wonder what awaits them if they make their own person
        pilgrimage to see this awesome sight. It is sort of like
        Disneyland, but people really believe they are going to
        see real buccaneers on the &quot;Pirates of the
        Carribean&quot;. As you enter the charming riverside
        compound you see the cheesey cathedral ahead of you. It
        sits on the cliff above Bernie&#146;s grotto. On the way
        to the church is the disabled visitors center, complete
        with hundreds of wheelchairs to accommodate handicapped
        visitors. We saw as many wheeled back away from the
        grotto as wheeled there. No cures on this day.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Just below and to the
        right of the church is Candleland. Here you can purchase
        (I mean make a suggested donation for) a candle to place
        near the shrine. Andrew stole a three foot long one and
        carted it with us to the line for entry into the grotto.
        The line moved quickly as ushers pushed people through.
        They showed especially pathetic visitors the best places
        to rub the rocks to receive its magical power. After
        passing through there is a bin where you can toss your
        candle and the attendants say that they will eventually
        light it for you. Andrew and I strongly suspect that they
        actually take the candle back to Candleland so that it
        can be resold. Just in front of the grotto is a VIP (very
        important prayer) area where believers chant, pray,
        kneel, sing, drool and imagine Mary in the Grotto saying
        something like &quot;I am the ultimate marketing
        tool.&quot;</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Between Candleland and
        Pirates of the Grotto is Lourdes waterslide equivalent
        unit. Here thousands line up to fill up their Mary shaped
        bottles with tap water. Housewives push the infirm out of
        the way to douse their aching feet with the blessed water
        that the townspeople are washing dishes and flushing
        toilets with. They lug gallons of the stuff all around
        the site with them. No wonder no one was cured. I knocked
        over some dude with crutches to fill my water bottle with
        the some and posed for a photo. Just beyond the grotto is
        a bath house where the infirm can pay to be bathed in the
        holy healing waters of Lourdes. Outside people sing and
        pray while they wheel them in dry on one side and roll
        them out wet and poorer on the other.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The saddest part about
        Lourdes is that it is not even very interesting.
        You&#146;d think that if the church was suckering this
        much money for candles out of cripples they&#146;d make
        it as spectacular as the Vatican. They could just loan
        Lourdes a few little trinkets to make it more
        interesting. And for god&#146;s sake, where are the
        refreshment stands? All you can get is water and that
        must be fought for&#133;.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">We escaped after
        purchasing the requisite postcards and water bottle.
        Minutes after leaving we were winding down river to Pau.
        The scenery was phenomenal though the road busy. With the
        wind at our backs and a gradual downhill we&#146;d made
        Pau in less than two hours. We&#146;d intended to stop
        for a coffee but nothing was open on Sunday until we
        reached Pau. Another spectacular of sorts was underway in
        Pau. The grand prix de Pau was in town. One of the last
        Formula Car races that still utilizes city streets. Auto
        racing seldom draws my favorite crowd, but Pau seemed
        accustomed to the event and the city handled the crowd
        well. We even managed to get a hotel room in the center
        without much difficulty. One hotel that couldn&#146;t
        find room for us told us to come back if we couldn&#146;t
        find anything and they promised to figure out somewhere
        for us to stay, even if it had to be the basement.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">We had dinner in the old
        quarter near the Chateau on the terrace and watched the
        sky turn colors as we ate desert. We watched the slow
        cars race around the center as the sun star</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">ted to set. Andy kept
        insisting that he could drive faster than the racers,
        maybe even bike faster&#133;</font></p>
