    <td width="358"><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="2"><b>25 Sept., Hengyang to Hengshan/Xiangtan,
    61km (f) </b><p>We&#146;d taken the day off in Hengyang with the intent of catching up on
    our writing and updating our website. That was not to be. Though Connie the Compaq has
    served us well over the last 17 months enduring all sorts of indignities she finally
    &quot;called it quits&quot;. It left us wondering if we&#146;d be making the rest of the
    journey without a computer. We&#146;d asked the rhetorical question of ourselves many
    times: &quot;Is this trip about a computer and website or seeing and experiencing the
    world?&quot; I must admit I was saddened by the passing of Connie but happy about the
    prospect of having the chance to answer this question.</p>
    <p>The following morning a terrible cold dogged me and I felt more awful than I could even
    imagine. My throat felt as though someone made me drink battery acid. Even worse than that
    we had been fighting a headwind for days and looking out the window this morning I find
    that the there was a stiff breeze coming from our direction of travel. After we
    breakfasted on mooncakes (they were luckily my favorite variety, stuffed with dried fruit
    and nuts) we hit the road. I was so frustrated with the day&#146;s journey that would it
    have had any effect on it I would have actually &quot;hit&quot; the road with my fists. It
    was a terrible route.</p>
    <p>There was a massive amount of road construction, leaving us to ride over a variety of
    surfaces. It was mostly dirty and bumpy with occasional stretches of smooth new concrete.
    The road was really the least of our worries. More unnerving were the trucks and busses
    caught in the traffic caused by the construction. When they were stopped they were an
    obstacle. Honking and trying to sneak up the side, they often blocked our passage. Moving,
    they menaced us with their horns while passing too closely.</p>
    <p>After only a few hours I was ready to deem this the absolute worst riding day in Asia.
    I was also ready to tell Andrew I&#146;d had it with China and wanted to go to some
    destination where the riding was rewarding again. I didn&#146;t know where I wanted to go,
    but anywhere but there would do. I hated Hunan, the people there who tried to rip us off,
    their rotten roads and inconsiderate drivers.</p>
    <p>The day wasn&#146;t entirely without amusement, however. A cottage industry of sorts
    had sprung up along the roadside. Every kilometer or so in either direction we&#146;d come
    upon a rather intricately made up young lady wearing a tastelessly revealing outfit,
    swinging her purse into traffic and trying to get the attention of passing drivers. Ruby
    red lipstick, Star Trek eye shadow treatments and huge amounts of rouge made the roadside
    &quot;workers&quot; look like clowns more than streetwalkers. When we realized that they
    weren&#146;t looking for rides of a conventional sort we dubbed them HHHs (Hunan Highway
    Hookers).</p>
    <p>Competing with the HHHs for the attentions of the drivers were restaurant workers.
    Every few hundred meters there was a noodle shop or strip mall store with a few tables all
    trying to get drivers to stop for a snack. Each establishment dolled up its prettiest
    employees and sent them out in front to attract people to stop and eat. It became
    confusing for me and I found it difficult to tell the HHHs from the waitresses.</p>
    <p>After seventy kilometers of dirt, dust, whores and honking we&#146;d both had it. We
    sought a bus to take us the remaining kilometers of the day. We&#146;d grown cranky and no
    longer tolerated people pawing our bikes and bags while waiting for the bus. Andy dealt
    swift and moist justice to anyone invading our space with his squirt gun. </font></td>

    <td width="395"><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="2"><b>26 September, Xiangtan to Shaoshan, 50km
    (a)</b><p>Brr. We shivered through our al fresco breakfast of noodles and wondered if
    summer was over for good in this part of the world. Heading out of town on Shaoshan Street
    (naturally), I thought how much I liked this burg. I know that Fred has developed an
    aversion to anything connected to Hunan province, but I found Xiangtan to be a happening
    friendly city, full of old tree-lined streets and touches of &quot;Old Cathay.&quot; </p>
    <p>The highway leading West was pretty busy, but not nearly as bad as the 322, the
    north-south road we&#146;d been traveling for several days, and the main truck route
    connecting Beijing and Guangzhou. Today&#146;s route felt like a country lane in
    comparison, passing through farming towns and carrying lots of tractor and animal-drawn
    traffic. It got even quieter once we made the turn toward Shaoshan, up through
    tree-covered hills. We noticed that most of the peasants here were dressed in &quot;Mao
    suits&quot;, the navy blue working uniforms one associates with the Cultural Revolution.
    Many of the locals were of the sturdy smiling variety, looking like living tableaux of
    Maoist propaganda posters. It all seemed appropriate given today&#146;s destination, the
    closest thing to a pilgrimage site in a country whose state religion is atheism.</p>
    <p>The scenery got increasingly beautiful as we approached Shaoshan. Unfortunately, the
    low-lying clouds made the mountaintops invisible, but we appreciated seeing forests for a
    change. The actual village of Shaoshan came as a serious disappointment, though. It&#146;s
    a place of tourism gone awry, where the locals appear absolutely desperate for cash.
    Shaoshan has the air of a faded pilgrimage sight, an outmoded Lourdes for hard-line
    communists. In the middle of the village stands a huge bronze statue of the Great Helmsman
    &#150;the only one we&#146;ve seen in China so far. The main attraction here, though, is
    Mao&#146;s childhood home. We were anxious to see it, but decided to get settled first.
    &#150;Not exactly an easy task in grotty, commie-style Shaoshan. All the places we
    inspected looked like they hadn&#146;t been cleaned since Mao left town, and none had hot
    water before late in the afternoon. Adding insult to injury, all were quoting ridiculously
    high rates. We probably should have made a quick visit to Mao&#146;s house and got the
    hell out of Dodge, yet settled on the cheapest (and possibly grossest) place we looked at:
    fifty yuan for a serious dump, run by an overeager woman who spoke a little English. After
    a quick &quot;whore bath&quot; using a bucket and a towel, we head off in search of the
    Chairman&#146;s birthplace, just down the road.</p>
    <p>Mao&#146;s family was the richest in town, and they had the biggest house. It has been
    lovingly preserved and furnished; signs at the entrance entreat visitors not to spit on
    the floors, and for once people seemed to be obeying. We saw the kitchen &quot;where
    comrade Mao sometimes helped his mother in the preparation of meals&quot;, the stable
    &quot;where comrade Mao took care of the family&#146;s livestock&quot; and the bedroom
    &quot;where comrade Mao slept.&quot; Inane placards in Chinese and English were posted
    everywhere, just in case visitors needed to be reminded what a closet was for (&quot;where
    comrade Mao hung his clothes&quot;). After a quick tour through the sanitized attraction,
    we were starving. An entrepreneuse of the desperate variety literally dragged us to her
    nearby restaurant, where we waited endlessly for the few simple dishes we ordered. We also
    ordered tea something like six times before anyone would admit, &quot;<i>Meiyou</i>.&quot;
    A Chinese restaurant without tea? Something was definitely amiss here. </p>
    <p>Next we headed to the Mao market, selling a surprisingly narrow variety of Mao
    paraphernalia. The pushiness of the vendors drove us quickly out, though not before we
    bought some postcards and a silk tea towel bearing the face of Stalin. </p>
    <p>The Mao museum was also a big disappointment. Formerly the building housed two
    identical museums in order to deal with the throngs of pilgrims, but now they&#146;ve
    busted down the wall, giving the visitor the chance to walk bewilderedly through a vast
    maze of dusty unlit rooms, many holding nothing but a stepladder. Aside from some workers
    painting and the inevitable trinket sellers, we were the only people in the whole place.
    The best part by far was the &quot;reliquary.&quot; Here we were instructed to take off
    our shoes and slip plastic bags over our socks before entering a place vaguely reminiscent
    of the vault holding the Crown Jewels in London, only with filthy carpeting and
    grease-smudged <i>vitrines</i>. Housed behind glass was comrade Mao&#146;s toothbrush, his
    Ping-Pong paddles, and &#150;best of all&#151; the swimsuit he wore during his famous dip
    in the Yangtse late in his career. I first mistook this sacred relic for a slipcover for a
    couch, or maybe a tablecloth. Mao was one large dude. </p>
    <p>It was only four o&#146;clock or so and we felt like we&#146;d already &quot;done&quot;
    Shaoshan. A nap felt in order, so we returned to our truly vile lodgings for a mini siesta
    before dinner. When we went downstairs, the woman running our guesthouse blocked our way
    out the door to the street, pleading for us to eat there. We gestured to the karaoke
    machine and covered our ears, and she ran over to turn the nasty music down to a bearable
    level, at which point we made the mistake of conceding and sat down. Our hostess
    recommended we try &quot;comrade Mao&#146;s favorite dish; it&#146;s pork.&quot; We
    agreed, and as soon as the order had been taken the karoke was cranked up again.
    Mao&#146;s favorite dish turned out to be huge chunks of pig fat in a mildly spicy sauce
    (explaining the obscene swimtrunks). A bite or two was all I could handle without getting
    nauseous. I was miserable, telling Fred I would settle for nothing short of the best hotel
    in Changsha tomorrow night. Fortunately he agreed with me wholeheartedly. After many days
    on the gritty, deafening roads of Hunan, staying in tatty bordellos thinly disguised as
    hotels, we are definitely ready for a princess fix. </font></td>

    <td width="358"><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="2"><b>27-28 September, Changsha (f)</b><p>I slept
    fitfully. First of all, I was cold for the first time in ages. Second, I distinctly heard
    the ping-ping of rain on the roof of the shack next to our dingy hotel. All I could think
    of was riding in the soupy mess and shivering all day. When I finally got out of bed I was
    in an absolutely foul mood. We loaded our bikes and readied ourselves for departure.
    Somehow the hotel staff had convinced Andy that we should eat in their restaurant. I
    couldn&#146;t imagine we would after the karaoke experience the night before. </p>
    <p>We sat down and began to drink our respective hot beverages. (I have virtually given up
    coffee at this point. Now I only occasionally have a cup, leaving Andrew to believe that I
    am actually an alien.) Just after the waitress/desk clerk/maid took our order and ran back
    to the kitchen to assume her new duties as cook. As soon as she did another hotel employee
    dashed into the dining room and turned up the karaoke machine to full volume. Her action
    startled us into action. We grabbed our bikes and left without breakfast. The rain had
    deteriorated into a weak cold mist that made me shiver as we sought a quiet non-karaoke
    breakfast. It was easy enough to find some <i>jiaozi</i> (little won ton like dumplings)
    in soup to warm us before our ride.</p>
    <p>We started to ride out of town. As I pedaled the wet dirty road mess slopped up my leg.
    We looked at each other and put our bikes on a bus. The fare seemed inexpensive to go all
    the way to Changsha and it seemed strange that the driver wasn&#146;t interested in us
    putting the bikes on the roof and getting our bags out of the way. I wasn&#146;t so
    surprised when we were told to get off at the next town and that we&#146;d have to switch
    busses. However, we had been told that our fare would get us to Changsha and it was too
    much to take us only a few kilometers so we had yet another bus dispute that ended in our
    favor.</p>
    <p>The bus ride to Changsha was well advised. The rain continued and the road was a
    slippery and dangerous mess. We saw no fewer than three accidents on the way. One was a
    grisly bus collision and we passed while people were wandering around the crash scene
    covered in blood and dazed. Another had involved a car and bicycle, making me happy we
    decided not to ride.</p>
    <p>Fortunately when we arrived at the Changsha bus terminal the rain had stopped and the
    ground had begun to dry. The bus station was still several kilometers from the city and we
    would have to ride. It was one of the bigger cities we&#146;d been in. Huge roads
    crisscrossed the center with massive complicated intersections providing passage for
    bikes, cars and pedestrians through mazes of over and underpasses. We settled ourselves in
    Changsha&#146;s finest hotel (brand-new and forty-seven stories high!) to make up for the
    rustic nights before.</p>
    <p>I was looking forward to Changsha. We had read about a museum that &quot;had to be
    seen&quot;. We wound our way through town looking for it through a park that had moon
    festival displays set up all over it. The cheesy displays and carnival rides reminded me
    of my childhood and Purim carnivals at our local synagogue. When we finally found the
    museum it was 11:15 AM and they were about to close for lunch. We insisted that they let
    us in promising only to see the premier display &#150; the two thousand year-old woman.
    She&#146;d been found in the countryside buried in a series of lacquer boxes, the largest
    the size of a huge room. Her body had been exhumed and put in a massive refrigerator in
    the basement of the museum. Visitors could look down through glass at her body. Her organs
    had been placed in a separate fridge and you could view them as well. She was hard to see
    through the fogged up windows. Wiping them we got a decent view and I decided she looked a
    lot like Ho Chi Minh.</p>
    <p>Changsha is a happening town of over five million. At night the streets are full of
    people walking and shopping. I&#146;d decided that it was cold enough to buy a pair of
    shoes. My sandals just won&#146;t cut it on cold days like the ones just passed. I found a
    Nike knock-off that really amused me. Not only was the brand name hilarious but the shoe
    was attractive. They were called &quot;Kike&quot; and I couldn&#146;t wait to have a pair.
    Unfortunately they could only be found in Asian sizes. Leaving me only the possibility of
    imagining the response if I wore them to a Rosh Hashanah celebration at the temple. </p>
    <p>While shopping and walking we noticed a strange sight. Remember we are in the center of
    a town of over five million inhabitants, many kilometers from the nearest rice fields. Yet
    at nine at night right we observed a man driving three water buffalo down Changsha&#146;s
    main street. Was he lost? A little later we happened upon the closest thing to a gay bar
    we&#146;d seen in China. The black façade of Comrade&#146;s bar beckoned us. We entered
    to find a clearly homo staff, several bored looking clients and a drag queen. Our two
    beers cost us ten times what they would on the street, but it was worth it to see this
    glimpse of &#145;cosmopolitan&#146; China.</font></td>

    <td align="left" width="395"><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="2"><b>29 September, Changsha to
    Pingxiang, 135km (a)</b><p>Getting out of Changsha took some doing. The streets were total
    pandemonium, especially at one point in the road where there had been
    &#150;surprise&#151;an accident. To avoid the main road and its inevitable honk-a-thon, we
    followed an alternate route through rolling hills and valleys full of soon-to-be-harvested
    rice. While the road was badly surfaced, the riding was glorious. We had a tailwind for a
    change and were sharing the road with far more bicycle-bound peasants than evil honking
    trucks. And the only traffic jams we had to deal with were caused by colorful markets in
    the centers of small farming villages. </p>
    <p>At km50 we hit the main road just outside the hideous outskirts of Zhuzhou, yet another
    massive city I&#146;d never heard of before this trip. We pedaled happily past a sign
    clearly forbidding bicycle traffic onto a long raised viaduct resembling the Chicago
    Skyway and continued onward on the freeway-like highway for the remainder of the day.</p>
    <p>--And it was the best road we&#146;ve been on so far in the PRC&nbsp;: wide, with a
    good shoulder for riding, nicely graded and &#150;best of all&#151; hardly any honking
    trucks. With a continuing tailwind the kilometers clicked over quickly under our wheels.
    At km100 we stopped at an exit to the sinister-looking town of Liling, wondering if we
    should stop for lunch and perhaps a bus to our night&#146;s destination. Both ideas were
    nixed, due to the perfect riding conditions. Exiting the highway also risked gettting
    flack from people at the tollbooth and being forced to take the old road, and at our
    current pace we could reach Pingxiang faster than any bus. </p>
    <p>A couple of scary tunnels brought us to the Hunan-Jiangxi border, where we stopped for
    a water break. After a few moments of playing coy, the people hanging around
    &#150;including a trio of cops&#151;gathered up the courage to approach us and ask a few
    questions. Their accent was the strangest I&#146;ve yet heard in China, sounding more like
    Finnish than Chinese, yet I managed to answer their most urgent queries, providing them
    with the usual spiel. For his part, Fred distributed postcards of comrade Mao purchased in
    Shaoshan, each of which we were both required to sign as a memento. Fred, given to
    hyperbole and generalization, claimed he already liked Jiangxi better than
    Hunan.&nbsp;&#145;People are friendlier in this province,&nbsp;&#145; he proclaimed,
    &#145;and they don&#146;t honk as much.&#146;</p>
    <p>The remaining kilometers to Pingxiang were hilly and pretty. At the border the road had
    transformed itself into an ordinary highway so we were rolling right through villages and
    towns again, which meant there was more to look at and more to watch out for. As on any
    long day of cycling, the last ten kilometers were the toughest. By the time we reached the
    outskirts of town we had a sizable escort, mostly on motorbikes, competing for our
    attention. The most persistent of these actually proved helpful, aiding us in finding a
    hotel in this big industrul town of one million or so. Pingxiang feels more provincial
    than other towns its size we&#146;ve passed through. I doubt, for example, that
    there&#146;s a yuppie bar here. Even karaoke seems oddly absent. Instead, you have a more
    traditinoal, &#145;old style&#146; Chinese city, slower paced and full of friendly folk.
    The &#145;hello&#146;s&#146; we get here feel less irritating, more genuine, somehow, and
    no one has made any effort to rip us off. </p>
    <p>After stuffing ourselves with a huge assortment of dumplings and other treats (only a
    buck for seven plates of food) we caught a micro taxi &#150;actually just a 3-wheeled
    motorcycle with a fiberglass hull&#151;to the train station for a masochistic bout with
    idiotic functionaries and impatient, shoving ticket-buyers. On our walk back a bunch of
    boys (we&#146;re convinced they&#146;re cuter here than in Hunan) strode alongside us,
    instant friends. They invited us to join them for dinner but we&#146;re too zonked,
    especially Fred, who snores in the bed beside me as I scribble these lines.</font></td>

    <td width="358"><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="2"><b>30 September, Pingxiang to Xinyu, 126km (f)</b><p>Finally&nbsp;!&nbsp;!&nbsp;!
    A tailwind&nbsp;!&nbsp;!&nbsp;! Will wonders never cease? I thought I&#146;d never have an
    easy day of cycling again. Today as we mounted our bikes it picked me up and pushed me
    along. I&#146;d forgotten what it felt like to be light and free on my bike and racing
    with the wind.</p>
    <p>Helping me stay motivated was the georgeous scenery. Fields of rice ready for harvest
    stood on either side of the road. Later in the day we saw peasants cutting and hauling
    rice back to to the mills for separation and drying. We hadn&#146;t seen a rice harvest in
    months and it was fun to watch the differences between Chinese methods and those used in
    South East Asia.</p>
    <p>One shocking moment was when we left town. Just a few kilometers out we saw a group of
    cycle tourists heading towards us. We passed them without them understanding who or what
    we were and it took a moment for them to realize that we were doing the same thing and to
    double back. There were five of them and they rode down the highway side-by-side without
    care for the traffic. Not really well outfitted for the task on five speed bikes and
    without any protective equipment, at least they were touring. Surprising to find our first
    fellow tourists in China were actually Chinese.</p>
    <p>After lunch the road opened up and became a huge and wide new asphalt affair that was
    absolutely empty. We shared it only with other cyclists and the wind started blowing at us
    again. I could tolerate a half day of wind after having the glorious morning tailwind. The
    terrain became more hilly and rocky and the dwellings were more traditional. Long
    two-story barns constructed of mud brick with intricate roofs appeared as the ugly cement
    mid rises disappeared.</p>
    <p>The entrance of Xinyu appeared a few hours later. We had to follow a circuitous route
    into town and had trouble locating the center. We finally found it and a reasonably modern
    hotel. Our room had been well worn by previous Chinese occupants. (It is our theory that
    Chinese people are hard on hotel rooms.) Our room looked as though abortions had been
    performed on the carpet. I feared walking on it even in shoes. There were peach pits on
    the floor and the bathroom was decidedly unclean (the
    dirt-smudged&nbsp;&#145;sanitized&#146; ribbon on the toilet notwithstanding). Surprising
    for a place that could only be a few years old. We escaped the depressingly dirty confines
    of our room for a walk about town.</p>
    <p>Xinyu felt more communist than most places we&#146;d been. Wide boulevards full of
    shops that had rather dated goods, big treeless parks and lots of sour-faced locals. After
    our walk and dinner along the park at a dog restaurant (no we did not eat dog, but could
    have&#133;.) we strolled through the park where some rather eager teenage boys tried to
    &#145;pick us up&#146; unsuccessfully. After dark the park was happening. Full to the brim
    with Chinese townspeople amusing themselves at carnival style games and eating snacks. At
    one little stand you could throw darts at a board to win a prize. Fearless park goers
    walked behind and in front of the dartboard apparently trusting that the thrower would not

    <td align="left" width="395"><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="2"><b>1 October, Xinyu to
    Zhangzhu/Nanchang, 97km (a)</b><p>Leaving Xinyu this morning, we felt like salmon swimming
    upstream. It must have been rush hour, with a huge tidal wave of bicycles flowing into
    town &#150;fifteen solid kilometers of Flying Pigeon-straddling commuters. Leaving
    civilization behind, we climbed up through forests of carefully arranged pine trees, then
    down through plantations of bushy plants that might have been mulberry for silkworm food.
    Back on the alluvial plain, rice was in the process of being harvested. The latter part of
    today&#146;s ride, though, looked like Nebraska or Kansas, with barren rolling hills and
    nary a soul in sight. </p>
    <p>We stopped for lunch in the nasty little railroad town of Linjiangzhen, watching
    villagers outside unload cages of dogs from atop buses. They were of the big, German
    Shepard type, bred for their meat rather than companionship. The noodles we had ordered
    were so spicy as to be almost inedible, and we wasted no time getting back on the road. </p>
    <p>The wind had kicked up and was blowing straight at us, making the cycling no fun at
    all. It wasn&#146;t hard convincing Fred that we should bus it from the next town to
    Nanchang, Jianxi&#146;s capital city. </p>
    <p>An hour and a half later we were crossing a huge bridge over a huge river into the huge
    town of Zhangzhu (also known as Qingjiang &#150;why do so many Chinese towns have two or
    more names&nbsp;?). Finding a bus took no time at all, and soon I was looking out the
    window from my perch next to the driver, very glad indeed that we weren&#146;t riding on
    such a busy road. </p>
    <p>Outside Nanchang the road joined a superhighway that looked like it was teleported from
    the future. When the town appeared Fred and I were stunned. It seemed to go on forever in
    every direction, with no apparent center. Is Nanchang the LA of China&nbsp;?</p>
    <p>We rode into what people had indicated was the center of town, along a broad avenue
    filled with all kinds of traffic. Nanchang is the kind of place that makes you realize
    that these people (i.e. the Chinese) will soon be masters of the planet. We stopped beside
    a massive square decorated with big balloons and giant portraits of Mao and Zhou En
    Lai.&nbsp;&#145;What&quot;s going on&nbsp;?&#146; I asked one of the many people milling
    about.&nbsp;&#145;It&#146;s National Day,&#146; he reminded me in a tone usually reserved
    for speaking to morons (a tone I find myself using a lot in this country full of ADD
    sufferers). The same man told me that the best hotel in town was just down the street. </p>
    <p>The Jiangxi Binguan is not only the best hotel in Nanchang, but by far and away the
    best place we&#146;ve stayed in China. Built for communist officials in the
    &#145;60&#146;s, the rooms are huge and solidly constructed, and it&#146;s the only place
    we&#146;ve seen that features actual character. Add in great food, incredibly helpful
    staff and a whopping 50% discount (on the country&#146;s biggest holiday, no less) and
    you&#146;ve got the recipe for bestowal of the BikeBrats Award for Excellence in Lodging. </p>
    <p>We had decided to join my father and Leslie in Hangzhou rather than in the mountains,
    due to our aversion towards climbing and lack of anything warm to wear. So our main
    concern upon arrival in Nanchang was getting tickets out. Both the front desk and the
    business center told us that the first available train tickets they could find would be
    some six days later &#150;not an acceptable option. &#145;What about CITS&nbsp;?&#146; we
    asked, referring to the Chinese tourist authority allegedly able to fix such problems. The
    response wasn&#146;t a welcome one&nbsp;: &#145;CITS has an office right here in the
    hotel,&#146; the desk staff informed us, &#145;but they won&quot;t be open for another
    four days due to the holiday weekend.&#146; The thought of a four-day weekend in this land
    of workaholics floored both of us. We caught our breath and asked what we could do. They
    told us to try the train station, where we elbowed our way to the window only to get the
    same negative response. </p>
    <p>&#145;How about flights to Hangzhou&nbsp;?&#146; I continued to pester the
    receptionist. She told us that the only flight available was the next morning, but that
    they wouldn&#146;t take bikes. Some brainracking yielded the idea that we could ship the
    bikes by train and fly the next morning. As both of us were looking forward to a
    well-earned day of rest after three tough days of riding, we weren&#146;t exactly thrilled
    by the prospect, but we accepted our fate as the only one available to us. We went
    upstairs, packed up our bikes with everything we wanted shipped, and went down to the
    business center to buy the air tickets. A last-minute call informed us that the train
    wouldn&#146;t ship our bikes without our possessing tickets, and we found ourselves back
    at square one. I put on my most pathetic expression and asked once more if anything could
    be done, to which the remarkably clever young woman behind the counter said, &#145;Yes,
    there is actually one possibility. Come back here at nine-forty-five and I&#146;ll know if
    we can find you some train tickets somehow.&#146; Just how this &#145;somehow&#146; works
    is a mystery to me in byzantine China, but I assume it has something to do with party
    connections. In any case, we figured we were now entirely at this woman&quot;s mercy and
    went to one of the hotel&#146;s many restaurants for dinner. </p>
    <p>Here we ran into a large group of Americans adopting Chinese babies. One couple sitting
    at the table next to us were feeding a totally adorable little girl. &#145;Next time
    we&#146;re going to Vietnam,&#146; her new mom explained, &#145;you can get boys
    there.&#146; </p>
    <p>During our post-dinner walk around town we were overwhelmed by the masses of humanity.
    The town&#146;s central square was now jam-packed, as were all the streets around it.
    Thousands and thousands of people, and all of them Chinese. It wasn&#146;t easy fighting
    our way through the crowd, but the diminutive stature and general calm demeanor of the
    people made the experience more bearable &#150;festive even-- than the expected
    claustrophobic nightmare. Nevertheless, we sought a quieter way back, wending our way
    through a labyrinth of narrow alleys and getting utterly lost.</p>
    <p>We made it back to the hotel just before the appointed hour, and the woman at the
    business center was wearing a big smile when we ran in, fairly panting in our
    anticipation.&nbsp;&#145;I found you a pair of tickets,&#146; she said with a hint of
    triumph in her voice, &#145;but they&#146;re for tomorrow rather than the next day and
    they&#146;re in hard sleeper rather than soft.&#146; </p>
    <p>&#145;We&#146;ll take them&nbsp;!&#146; we chorused, and went upstairs for bed, sad to
    be leaving this interesting town a day earlier than we&#146;d hoped, but happy to be on
    our way to see Jack and Leslie. Both of us felt ready to see some familiar faces among all
    the alien strangeness of the Middle Kingdom.</font></td>
