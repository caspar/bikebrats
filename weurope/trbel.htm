        Dunkerque to Brugge, Belgium, 82km</b></font><p><font size="2" face="Arial">I awoke in our walnut-sized hotel
        room to find that my throat hurt. Grumpily we made our
        way downstairs for what was anticipated to be yet another
        meager continental breakfast. Our expectations were not
        unsatisfied. On the way out the door of our room Andrew
        discovered he&#146;d lost his wallet. He tore apart
        everything in the room looking for it and was decidedly
        panicky as we went in search of coffee. Though the
        breakfast was not fulfilling the fact that the hotel
        administration had found his wallet quieted Andrew. It
        wasn&#146;t exactly raining as we lowered our bikes down
        two flights of stairs but a thick mist coated everything
        with water. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">By the time we started
        riding it was raining lightly. France seemed to have a
        hold on us, we even had difficulty leaving Dunkirk. A
        huge Sunday market blocked the route out of town so we
        had to zig and zag to find a way out. Dunkirkians had
        wildly different opinions about the distance to the
        frontier of Belgium. Estimations ranged from 40 to 2k.
        The actual distance turned out to be the average.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The terrain in Belgium was
        flat, flat and flatter. It seemed strange to have a
        panorama from any point. I had the sensation that on a
        clear day I could see Amsterdam. The weather remained
        dreary as we pedaled into Veurne for a late lunch. The
        rain had stopped falling but the air was so moist it was
        difficult to distinguish from the rain. We had trouble
        finding a banking machine that would take our cards and
        were thoroughly frustrated when we seated ourselves for a
        midday meal. At lunch the center square came into focus
        for me. I started to notice the rich details of Belgian
        architecture. This town had been headquarters for the
        Belgian military during the first war and severely bombed
        during both. The public works project restoring the
        cobbles in the square and the newer brick half way up the
        church tower were the only reminders of that era.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Following lunch we wove
        our way through fields of wheat, corn, cows and sheep. We
        passed happy cyclists on paths constructed just for us.
        What a change from Britain, we felt at home on our bikes.
        Andrew recalled his childhood experience in Brugge and
        painted a glorious picture of the town. It was a painless
        entry, pathways for bicyclists invited us into Brugge.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Of recent construction,
        (compared to most European cities founded in the eight
        century), Brugge&#146;s dramatic skyline of jagged
        facades, gothic towers and red tiled roofs was a welcome
        sight after 80k riding. A warm bath readied us for a walk
        about the center and a dinner in a charming restaurant
        housed in the ancient cellar of a former convent. We went
        in search of Brugge night life only to find it was not to
        be on a Sunday night.</font></p>

    <tr>
        <td><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>1 July, Brugges to
        Antwerp, 113km</b></font><p><font size="2" face="Arial">We
        couldn&#146;t have picked a better day to take a break
        from riding and to explore Brugge, since the weather was
        perfectly miserable. I spent most of the morning doing
        laundry, and went museum-hopping with Fred in the
        afternoon before a nap and watching Hong Kong be absorbed
        into the People&#146;s Republic of China on CNN. We
        returned to a nearby queer bar for cocktail hour, but it
        was pretty beat. Just as the night before, all the
        Flemish-spouting locals treated us as if we were
        invisible, showing not so much of a glimmer of interest
        or friendliness. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">When we awoke the next
        morning it still looked majorly ugly outside our window,
        but we were committed to pushing on towards Antwerp.
        Getting out of town was a piece of cake. All the main
        roads in Belgium seem to have bike lanes, and we were
        soon surrounded by cows and trees. I am always struck by
        how quickly European cities cede to countryside, with
        hardly any of the nasty endless suburbs that characterize
        American towns. It should be said, however, that there
        doesn&#146;t appear to be much countryside in Flanders,
        which is one of the most densely populated areas on the
        planet. Most of the day&#146;s ride was through a sort of
        brick corridor of villages that lined our route. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">It wasn&#146;t long before
        we were pedaling through the vast industrial wasteland
        around Gent under drizzling skies. I spotted a
        brightly-colored frites hut amidst all the grayness, and
        thought it would be a good place to have lunch and seek
        refuge from the rain. Frites (the Belgians would never
        call them French fries) are truly the pinnacle of Flemish
        cuisine. They are always hot, tasty and copious, and may
        be accompanied by any number of exotic-sounding sauces.
        Determined to sample every variety before leaving the low
        countries, Fred and I ordered Samurai sauce this time,
        and it was delicious. We munched our fries and watched
        the skies open up outside, thankful for having found
        shelter.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The downpour didn&#146;t
        last long, though, and soon we were riding over the
        brutal cobblestone streets of central Gent. It&#146;s an
        old market town with lots of fine old buildings, but
        possessing little of the appeal of Brugge. We visited
        many of the sites from our saddles --the market square
        and city hall, the quaysides, the castle formerly
        inhabited by the Dukes of Flanders&#151;before stopping
        at the cathedral which houses a famous polyptych (like a
        triptych but with more panels) by Van Eyck. At the center
        of the painting is a holy, smug-looking sheep bleeding
        into a chalice, surrounded by hundreds of adoring
        onlookers. The details and the colors were exceptionally
        vivid and I wondered how the painting had endured the
        centuries so beautifully. The rest of the church was a
        treasure trove of more triptychs and over-the-top
        architectural details. I could have spent hours there,
        but Fred was outside with the bikes, waiting for it to be
        his turn. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">I found him engaged in
        conversation with two young bicycle taxi drivers. They
        were part of a brand new youth employment program based
        on high-tech pedal-powered vehicles reminiscent of the
        becaks of Java. They said business hadn&#146;t been so
        great so far, but they looked mighty stylin&#146; in
        their yellow machines, which had wheel bases identical to
        the city&#146;s tramways&#146;, thus minimizing the
        jarring effects of cobblestones. When they said that the
        road to Antwerp would be hilly, we thought they were
        kidding. But there were actually some rolling hills
        between Gent and Antwerp, and the scenery and weather
        were beautiful. Fred didn&#146;t seem to be appreciating
        it, however, as he grew increasingly cranky as we neared
        Antwerp. I guess he needed some food in his belly, and we
        had no local currency left with which to buy any. After
        asking several clueless and monolingual locals where we
        could find a ferry across the river to Antwerp (riding
        into town through the tunnel just didn&#146;t cut it for
        me), a friendly Flem on a bike appeared out of nowhere
        and produced a ferry schedule. He told us to follow
        little bike trails &quot;around the church, and then
        around the moat of the castle, through the woods to the
        riverbank.&quot; The ride was as enchanting as it
        sounded, and soon we were aboard a (mercifully free)
        ferry with several other fietsers (the only Flemish word
        I picked up, meaning &quot;cyclist&quot;). </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The ride into town was
        predictably unattractive, though there was a fietspad
        (bike path) the whole way. Antwerp and its suburbs
        &#150;like Hoboken, which we were pleased to cycle
        through&#151;are a sprawling mass of Flemish efficiency.
        The old part of town was a glorious collection of old
        guild halls arranged around asymmetrical squares. There
        were restaurants and cafes everywhere, but not a single
        hotel to be found in the historic center. I guess Antwerp
        is not a major stop on the tourist trail. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">We finally found lodgings
        near the railway station, which worked out nicely, since
        we were steps away from the homo district and my intended
        dinner destination: an Indonesian restaurant listed in
        the Spartacus guide. Gay Indonesian food being my idea of
        gastronomic perfection, I rushed to call and make a
        reservation before washing off the day&#146;s layer of
        grime. The reservation was unnecessary, however; we
        turned out to be the only customers in the place. Our
        server was an outrageous and perfectly anglophonic drag
        queen from Yogyakarta. Her name was Georgie and she
        explained that she owned the restaurant with her Belgian
        &quot;husband&quot; and had lived in Antwerp for over
        twenty years. Her hairdo was inspired by Tina
        Turner&#146;s and she had selected apricot as her nail
        polish color. We spoke in a mixture of English and Bahasa
        Indonesia as she brought out plate after plate of our
        tasty Rijstafel (the Dutch interpretation of Indonesian
        cuisine) and recommended venues in which to continue our
        evening out.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The last time I had been
        to Antwerp I had made a pilgrimage to a leather bar
        called &quot;Milwaukee,&quot; but apparently the place no
        longer existed. Instead, we walked up and down a street
        packed with identical little gay bars. None of them
        really struck our fancy, however, and we made the
        terrible mistake of turning into a side street full of
        windows framed in pink neon. In each was an overly eager
        African whore, tapping on the glass and urging us to come
        in. Most of these girls were quite beautiful, but the
        overall scene was definitely depressing, so we headed
        back to homo street. After Fred to return to our hotel, I
        met a couple of Flemish guys called Peter and Paul (yes,
        Belgium is about as Catholic a country as you can find).
        Paul didn&#146;t speak English and seemed more interested
        in his beer anyway, but Peter was extraordinarily
        articulate and enthusiastic, not at all like any other
        Flemish people we had met. He was a cyclist, too, he
        said, and he told me of his bicycle journeys before
        launching into a defense of his faith. He was both a
        practicing homosexual and a practicing Catholic, and
        while he sees the inherent paradox in this, his religion
        remains an important part of his life. I could have
        baited him on the subject for hours, but it was really
        feeling like time for bed&#133; </font></p>

        Stettendam, Holland, 92km</b></font><p><font size="2" face="Arial">It seems like we are starting our days later
        and later. My limbs seem to get oh-so-heavy at the
        thought of leaving the warmth and safety of our resting
        place. The weather has a lot to do with it, neither of us
        is wild about the idea of riding in the rain. This day
        begins gray but dry.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">We pass into Holland soon
        after beginning our ride. Andrew had planned a rural
        route but we made a wrong turn and went through ugly
        suburban border town to ugly suburban border town before
        making the crossing. Even though it wasn&#146;t scenic it
        was almost pleasant, what a difference it makes when
        there are bike paths.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">We left one bicycling
        nirvana for another as we entered Holland. At the border
        the town immediately turned more charming. The buildings
        brick and slightly smaller, streets cleaner, and, if
        possible, even more cyclists. Quickly we found ourselves
        in the Dutch Alps reaching altitudes approaching
        twenty-five meters. We risked a nosebleed and stopped for
        a picnic lunch in the forest.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Soon we learned the best
        way to navigate our way through the Netherlands. Pick the
        towns that you want to pass through on a map and follow
        the white signs with red letters that tell cyclists how
        to get to those towns. Within a few kilometers Andy was
        touting this new methodology and marveling at the road
        planner&#146;s routings. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Ducked into a hipster
        café in a rural Dutch town (Bergen op Zoom) for coffee
        while the rain pounded the pavement mercilessly. Thus
        began our day in the rain. At first it was merely an
        annoying drizzle but it gradually developed into a
        constant drench. Stopped into a snack shop for an order
        of fry&#146;s (our new preferred snack) this time with a
        peanuyty Saté sauce.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">One town later we were
        ready to stop for a day, regrettably the nearest hotel
        was behind us and neither of us are big on backtracking.
        We bit the bullet and decided to ride in the rain for
        another 25K to our planned destination. Ten kilometers
        down the path Andy spotted a sign with his &quot;favorite
        word in the English language&quot; on it,
        &quot;motel.&quot; Within a few minutes we rolled our
        bikes into our private motel-hut. It had a living room,
        two sleeping lofts, a dining room, kitchen, satellite TV
        and a bathroom that was apparently stolen from the
        smallest motor home on earth. Showering while using the
        toilet and washing your face in the sink was possible.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Coincidentally, as we
        checked in, someone was using our exact same computer to
        download their e-mail at the bar (the only option as
        there were no phones in the rooms.) John, the owner of
        the computer, and his girlfriend Nelly were on a two
        month vacation in Europe. John, a retired two-star
        officer of the Air Force, lives a fairy-tale life.
        Traveling and boating while managing his remote business
        and investing. Nelly and John are living my dream life.
        We hit it off immediately. We shared a bottle of wine,
        conversation, dinner and breakfast the next morning. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">There was only one dark
        moment (besides the weather), in an e-mail that night I
        found that my uncle was gravely ill in Texas. He is the
        husband of Anita who you may remember from our tales of
        the lone star state. I find myself very sad and worried
        for him and his family. This day is dedicated to them.</font></p>

        <td><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>3 July, Stettendem to
        Delft/Amsterdam, 55km</b></font><p><font size="2" face="Arial">Many years ago I shared an apartment in
        Paris with a little Korean-American girl named Erica, who
        was the tiniest bit naïve. When I returned from a
        weekend in Amsterdam, I told her how I rented a bike and
        rode out into the countryside. &quot;What was it
        like?&quot; she asked. I told her it was full of tulips
        and windmills and dikes, to which she replied with
        horror, &quot;Mean ones?&quot; Apparently her only
        contact with dikes were of the militant Yale variety
        found in New Haven. In any case, we spent much of today
        riding on dikes again; we were bikes on dikes.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">This morning was like
        waking up on another planet. The sun was shining and
        everything was green and glorious, and we realized with
        glee that a strong wind would blow us all the way to
        Amsterdam. After a long and leisurely breakfast with our
        new friends John and Nellie, we made it to Brielle
        &#150;yesterday&#146;s goal&#151;in record time. Brielle
        is a charming an interesting old town, heavily fortified
        by star-shaped city walls, with a network of canals lined
        by old crooked houses. We stopped long enough for
        incredibly awesome strawberry tarts at a salon de thé.
        After a couple of failed attempts, we found our way out
        of town, crossing a bridge over one channel of
        Europort/Rotterdam (the world&#146;s largest) and then a
        ferry across another. I was thrilled to see that most of
        the traffic on the ferry was other fietsers, and the
        steady stream of container-laden vessels was quite a
        sight. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The ride to Delft was
        fifteen kilometers of pedaling perfection. The wind was
        right at our backs, allowing us to cruise along at an
        effortless 30 kilometers per hour, along canals, past
        windmills and fields of flowers. Everywhere we looked
        bicycles were part of the landscape. The locals pedaled
        lazily along on their hulking black beasts, many of them
        wearing a distinctly self-satisfied smiles. Are the
        Netherlands a utopia for bikes? I think so. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Delft was bustling from
        the frenzy of consumerism than constitutes Market Day. It
        looked like an attractive little town &#150;sort of a
        mini Amsterdam&#151; but the jam-packed streets and
        squares made me feel a little claustrophobic. While
        munching on a sandwich on the crowded market square, Fred
        said he felt like training the remaining 60 or 70 km to
        Amsterdam. At first I thought I&#146;d bike up, but the
        idea sounded too tempting, and soon we were on our way to
        the train station. The place was a mess due to an
        accident on the rails (which we later learned was two
        trains hitting each other head on near Leiden). We had to
        be rerouted through Rotterdam, tripling the length of
        what would normally have been a 30-minute journey. Still,
        it was nice to be able to take an agouti nap and
        eavesdrop on the Britannic glamour princess cutting
        decorating deals over her cell phone in the seat behind
        me. She sounded just like Edina on &quot;Absolutely
        Fabulous.&quot;</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Unloading my bike off the
        train at Centraal Station, I was engulfed by a huge cloud
        of marijuana smoke on the platform. Yes, we had made it
        to Amsterdam. I led the way through busy streets to where
        I thought brother Marty&#146;s hotel was and we found the
        place without a problem. Mars and Siri showed up shortly
        after we got settled, full of stories from their own road
        trip from Aix-en-Provence and up through Switzerland and
        Germany. The distance they had covered in so little time
        seemed unfathomable to me, and then I remembered one of
        the advantages of motorized transport. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">We had another rijstafel
        dinner at a popular place across the street. While the
        food was far superior to our meal in Antwerp, none of our
        servers was in drag. Nevertheless, drag is what we did to
        Marty and Siri after our meal, to a trendoid queer café
        called Havana. We snagged a big round booth there and
        consumed multiple beers and talked about everything and
        everyone while our young bespectacled waiter flirted
        shamelessly with Fred. Later, it felt luxurious knowing
        that the next day there wouldn&#146;t be any riding to
        do, and that we had nothing planned. It felt almost like
        a vacation&#133;</font></p>

        <td><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>7 July, Amsterdam to
        Zwolle, 132 km</b></font><p><font size="2" face="Arial">Traveling
        alone in a foreign place, without the crutch-like comfort
        of a fellow traveler and compatriot, makes you feel much
        more like an alien. It had happened so suddenly, too. One
        minute we were packing up our bike bags and thinking of
        the day ahead, and the next Fred had decided to
        investigate flying back to the States for his
        uncle&#146;s funeral. When he came back a few minutes
        later, he said he had only 90 minutes to catch his
        flight, and that he&#146;d be gone for a week. Yikes, I
        thought, how am I going to fare all by myself?</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">It felt a bit odd at
        first, but soon I grew to enjoy the freedom of it, and
        the intensity of being alone with all of my thoughts and
        feelings. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">It wasn&#146;t easy
        getting out of Amsterdam, due to the overabundance of
        bike paths leading in every direction. They took me along
        canals and suburban streets, through socialist-style
        housing developments and scraggy forests. After thirty
        kilometers of pedaling, I saw a sign indicating that
        Amsterdam was only 16 km away by bike, which only served
        to make me feel stupid, unprepared, and helpless in my
        solitude. I crossed a massive bridge over a huge inlet
        called the Gooimeer onto the artificial island of
        Flevoland. Then I was in the polders again, part of the
        third of Holland that is reclaimed land, below the level
        of the sea. I followed an excellent fietspad that was
        like a freeway for bikes along a massive dike (I
        didn&#146;t catch her name), and was delighted to find
        that the wind was at my back again. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">In Almere Haven I sat down
        for a lunch of beer and frites (I figured I had only two
        days before Germany, and I wasn&#146;t sure to find
        frites there) and talked to an older French couple at the
        table next to mine. They were on bikes too, and were
        staying nearby at the house of a Dutch family who were at
        their place in Antibes through a housing exchange. They
        invited me to join them at their table and told me all
        sorts of stories, like how they lived on a remote island
        in the South Pacific for three years (&quot;way too
        long&quot;) and how Monsieur Lefebvre in his youth had
        spent a couple of summers hitchhiking his way across the
        USA. As he balanced his bulk onto the seat of his machine
        before pedaling away, I thought how much easier it is to
        meet people when you&#146;re alone. Still, I missed Fred,
        and wondered what he was thinking in the air above the
        Atlantic.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">After many more miles of
        rather boring dike riding, I crossed another bridge back
        to the mainland, where I promptly got lost. I was off the
        edge of my map, you see, and the familiar little
        red-and-white signs indicating bike routes were nowhere
        to be seen. I had to rely on directions given to me by
        old widows in Dutch on how to get to Putten.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">From Putten I followed a
        glorious series of fietspads through a huge (and hilly!)
        forest to Elspeet and Epe. It was here somewhere that I
        saw two men actually wearing wooden shoes, and I almost
        fell off my bike from the thrill it gave me. One guy was
        working in his garden and another was walking back from
        his mailbox with a newspaper. And their shoes were most
        definitely wooden.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">As the sun sank lower in
        the sky, I wondered if I would actually camp this night,
        but finally opted to push on to the larger town of
        Zwolle, where there would be a hotel. I had had enough of
        radical departure from the norm for one day. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Zwolle was another
        star-shaped fortress of a town. It felt elegant and
        bourgeois, with fine houses and shops. At the only hotel
        in town, the innkeeper said he had just one room left, up
        four narrow flights of stairs. After schlepping all my
        bags up (not to mention all the kilometers I&#146;d
        ridden), I felt too exhausted to do anything besides
        watch new images from Mars on CNN.</font></p>

        <td><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>8 July, Zwolle to Ter
        Apel, 114 km</b></font><p><font size="2" face="Arial">I
        saw a lot more of Zwolle the next morning. After
        procuring toothpaste and envelopes at a store called Hema
        (Dutch for &quot;Wal-Mart&quot;), I found my way to the
        post office. At first I thought I had entered the wrong
        building, for it didn&#146;t look like a post office at
        all. It was cozy and colorful, equal parts gift-and-card
        shop, kiddie playground, travel agent and
        bank-for-smurfs. Best of all, the employees were friendly
        and helpful and spoke perfect English. I considered
        bringing a picnic lunch back just in order to bask in the
        warm ambiance of the place, but decided to get on my bike
        and ride again.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Zwolle was much easier
        than Amsterdam to navigate my way out of, along a canal
        full of houseboats that looked like floating trailer
        homes, then past a lake with a beach and enough bike
        parking for what looked like the entire population of
        Holland. And then I was in the countryside again, at
        least until I got to Ommen, where some kind of festival
        was going on. All the bikes that should have been parked
        back at the beach were on the street in Ommen. It looked
        like China. I hastily postponed the lunch I planned to
        have there, and pedaled eastwards along the Vecht river
        through the most gorgeous scenery I came across in
        Holland, full of forests and chateaux and interesting
        rural architecture. I wasn&#146;t alone in my
        appreciation of the area, however, as there were scads of
        cycle tourists everywhere. I marveled at how nonchalantly
        they would dominate the roadway, thinking nothing of
        riding four abreast and laconically weaving into oncoming
        traffic. I remembered reading once of a law being passed
        in Holland which states that any accident between a car
        and a bicycle is automatically the fault of the motorist.
        While such a law is clearly designed in the interest of
        me and my fellow cyclists, I understood how open it is to
        abuse.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Unfortunately, the wind
        was in my face today, and I quickly realized that I would
        need copious amounts of fuel to deal with it. Lunch was
        in two parts: a cream puff with strawberries and coffee
        in Hardenberg and the now-traditional frites-and-beer in
        Coevorden. My belly full, I followed country roads to the
        ugly town of Emmen. Either it&#146;s a new town built to
        fit a &quot;socialist utopia&quot; blueprint, or it was
        totally destroyed in the war and rebuilt as quickly and
        cheaply as possible. In either case, it looks like
        Godard&#146;s &quot;Alphaville&quot;, with bike paths. My
        map showed a bike path to the north of Emmen leading
        through a forest and past a series of glyphs denoting
        &quot;megalithic remains.&quot; It wasn&#146;t exactly on
        my way, but it looked intriguing. The monuments ended up
        looking remarkably like the icons used to represent them
        on the map &#150;a sort of table formed by stacking a big
        rock on two smaller ones. Stonehenge it was not, but the
        path through the forest was nice, as was the deserted
        road that led me towards Ter Apel, a weird modern
        &quot;village&quot; arranged in quadrants that formed a
        perfect square on the map. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">One of these quadrants was
        the town campground (they are everywhere in Holland),
        organized around a square lake (at least it looked square
        on the map; in reality it was surprisingly pretty) and
        run by an elderly drunk woman who gave me serious red
        carpet treatment when she learned I was American. She
        paraded me about the campground telling everyone where I
        had come from, set me up in a prime location on the lake,
        and arranged coffee for me in the caravan/tent of my
        neighbor, who happened to be her cousin. It took me
        longer than it ought to have to set up my tent, and I
        wondered if anyone could tell that I was doing it for the
        first time. I made enormous efforts to appear casual
        throughout the process, like a seasoned camper. More than
        once the neighbor came by to remind me that coffee was
        ready, to which I&#146;d respond, &quot;I&#146;ll only be
        a minute&quot;, before grappling with the poles and flies
        and stakes once again. Looking up from what I was doing
        from time to time, I was pleased to see kids riding their
        bikes all over the campground in wooden shoes. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The neighbors were from
        Groningen in the North of Holland and were exceptionally
        kind. They came every year to spend all summer, and had
        even brought along their lawn ornaments and potted plants
        as decoration. Hans and Greta (not their real names) had
        brought along their studenty daughter Ilse who looked way
        too much younger than her parents to be anything but
        adopted, as well as their granddaughter (not
        Ilse&#146;s), who was already asleep. We talked
        extensively of the state of bicycling and bicycle theft
        in Holland (each member of the family had several tales
        to tell here) and ate cake. I left them after a while,
        though, eager to get clean and stretched before darkness
        set in at ten-thirty. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">It didn&#146;t take long
        for me to realize that coffee had been a mistake. It took
        me ages to get to sleep, and I had to get up twice during
        the short night to pee. And just before dropping off each
        time, I realized with a little shudder of horror that
        I&#146;d be spending most of the next day&#133; in
        Germany.</font></p>
