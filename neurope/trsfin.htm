        Mossala, 107 km</b></font><p><font size="2" face="Arial">Let
        the record state that Fred Felman will be sleeping in a
        tent tonight. Even as I write this, under the fading 11pm
        sun, he is busy arranging his nylon nest. Yes, we are
        camping. In the woods. With wild beasts for our
        neighbors. In Finland, of all places.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">We arrived in Turku this
        morning on a big beautiful ship operated by the Viking
        Line. There was only one other cyclist aboard, a maniac
        German from Hamburg who had ridden to Nordcapp &#150;the
        northernmost point of Europe&#151;and was now on his way
        home. He told us he&#146;d been on the road since May and
        had had only one day of bad weather. I found myself
        envying his pedaling through the night under the midnight
        sun and breathing the incomparably pure air. Looking at
        us and our quixotic machines, he said we were carrying
        way too much stuff (I personally consider our backgammon
        board and various beauty products a necessity, thank you
        very much), and assumed we&#146;d be sharing a cabin with
        him, explaining that Viking Line usually matches people
        up by similar interests, etc. We nodded our heads in a
        conciliatory way, for there was no arguing with this man,
        though we knew for a fact that we would not be his
        bunkmates for the night. Since we booked passage at the
        last minute, the only cabins available were the
        &quot;luxury&quot; ones on the top deck, which we figured
        were still cheaper than a night&#146;s stay in Stockholm.
        And bike brats are always up for a little dose of
        princessdom&#133; </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">In some ways the trip
        really started for me today, since Finland is the first
        country I hadn&#146;t been to before; I was penetrating
        virgin territory, an explorer. It looked and felt pretty
        much as I expected it would &#150;a Soviet-flavored
        version of Scandinavia-- as I roused myself to
        consciousness on the vast central square of Turku with a
        cup of coffee and a large sugary object that resembled a
        donut. The Soviet no-nonsense aesthetic was definitely
        present in the utilitarian architecture, but it all
        looked clean and prosperous like Sweden. The people
        strode about with confidence and purpose in the early
        morning rush hour. Nearly everyone we saw was scantily
        clad, in tank tops, miniskirts, and the like, even though
        it was freezing outside. I wondered if they knew
        something that we didn&#146;t.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">--And they did as a matter
        of fact, for today&#146;s weather was as close to sublime
        as we&#146;ve encountered all summer long. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">We decided to deviate
        wildly from our course and pedal westwards &#150;back
        towards Sweden&#151;to a group of islands called Aland
        (with a little circle over the &quot;a&quot;), but we
        weren&#146;t really sure which route to follow. Throwing
        caution to the wind, I let Fred decide. Our only
        restriction, after all, is that we have to be in Helsinki
        by Friday night to meet up with Olivier, which opens us
        up to a plethora of possibilities. Fred made his decision
        in a very logical way: He gauged the direction and speed
        of the wind and pronounced that we should head towards
        the Southwest. And soon we were on our way towards what
        is known as the Finnish Archipelago, consisting of over
        12,000 islands. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">We were delighted to find
        excellent bike paths running alongside the highways,
        indicating that we were still in a civilized country. The
        path we took led us through the town of Kaarina (home of
        gay pornographer Tom of Finland, we learned later from a
        straight girl in Turku), and shortly thereafter we were
        cruising through golden meadows hemmed in by pristine
        forests and ocean inlets. We had to pump up some
        seriously steep grades, too, something which our legs
        were no longer used to. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Just as I was thinking
        that Finland was a cycling paradise, our fantastic bike
        path came to an abrupt end, forcing us to share the road
        with the aggressive Finnish drivers. But after the first
        ferry crossing (traversing the archipelago requires
        taking many ferries, which adds to the appeal), we
        learned that if we waited for all the cars to exit before
        us, we&#146;d have the road to ourselves for twenty
        minutes, until the next ferry&#146;s cargo of cars caught
        up with us.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Twenty k and a couple of
        ferries later, we arrived at our first village, called
        Nagu. We stopped here for an elegant dockside lunch,
        setting us back a small fortune but almost worth it. Our
        waitress informed us that the tourist season was
        practically over, since Finnish schoolchildren resume
        their studies next week. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">A little beyond Nagu, we
        turned off from the main road onto a side road that
        quickly disintegrated to a sandy track. But the mellow
        scenery and total lack of motorized traffic made us push
        onwards rather than turn back. Shortly after the
        reappearance of blacktop, my front tire exploded,
        sounding like a bomb. In a way I was happy, because
        I&#146;d finally be able to put to use the spare tire
        I&#146;ve been lugging along for so many months. It
        couldn&#146;t have happened in a better place either: on
        a deserted road alongside a picturesque meadow. Changing
        the blown-out tire was almost a pleasure.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Another ferry took us to a
        larger island called Korpoo, where we planned to catch a
        longer-haul boat to Aland. But when we got to the docks a
        young, well-mannered schoolgirl informed us that it had
        just left, and that the only one tomorrow leaves at
        six-thirty in the morning. Forget that, I thought, and
        hastily put together a Plan B. We would jump on the next
        ferry that came, and see where it took us. I liked the
        spontaneity of the idea, and consider us lucky for Kismet
        to have brought us to Houtskar (pronounced
        &quot;Hoht-chorr&quot;), a group of postcardesque islands
        covered with little but wilderness. It was on this ferry
        that we met young Pepy (short for Petri), his wife Anne
        and his dog Minnie. Pepy had spent a couple of years
        being a pilot in Missouri, and now the three of them were
        on their way to meet up with Pepy&#146;s sister Piia for
        a few days of camping and canoeing.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Piia, it turns out, is
        married to a kooky hippyesque Canadian called Torbin,
        whom she met while touring with a musical group called
        &quot;Up with People.&quot; We met up with their whole
        gang when we finally reached the primitive campsite on
        the northernmost tip of this island group, twenty-odd
        kilometers and two more ferries from where we first
        disembarked into the beautiful universe of Houtskar. Fred
        had his heart on sleeping in the &quot;cottage
        village&quot; that was marked on my map, but no such
        thing matieralized. Nor was there a restaurant, unless
        you counted the nasty pub we had stopped at several hilly
        kilometers and one ferry ride back. We figured we&#146;d
        subsist on some of the snacks we had acquired over the
        course of the day, but Piia volunteered to drive us back
        to the &quot;pub,&quot; where the young couple introduced
        us to one of the staples of popular Finnish cuisine, a
        meat pie soaked in grease and stuffed with rice and
        sausage &#150;disgusting! Torbin, apparently thrilled to
        be talking with native English speakers, told us his
        amazing life story. Born to a draft dodger from Texas and
        a Danish mom, Torbin grew up in the wilderness of British
        Columbia, where he dreams to return some day if only Piia
        could get a work visa.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">When we returned to the
        campsite, another cyclist had appeared, a German called
        Richard.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">As I write this, the whole
        crowd is noisily grilling sausages on the beach and
        laughing at Pepy&#146;s crude jokes. I suppose I&#146;ll
        join them, even though I&#146;d rather just crawl into my
        sleeping bag and call it a night, letting myself dream of
        where tomorrow&#146;s ferries will take us in this
        magical archipelago.</font></p>

    <tr>
        <td><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>Mossala to Mariehamn,
        105km</b></font><p><font size="2" face="Arial">Our late
        afternoon/early evening entry into Mariehamn with fast
        traffic and steep hills couldn&#146;t erase from my
        memory what was the most sublime riding day in recent
        history. The night before we&#146;d met yet another
        German cyclist who had discarded his BMW and the autobahn
        for a bicycle in Scandanavia. Richard was alone (male
        German cyclists travel alone, and females in pairs) and
        very well equipped. His coffee pot burbling away on his
        cook stove was the noise that woke me at eight.
        Unaccustomed to outdoor life, I found myself a little out
        of sorts in this rustic surrounding. As disorienting as
        it was, I loved the sound of the ocean lapping against
        the rocks on the shore. It made a &quot;blooping&quot;
        noise, like the sound a cartoon character makes when they
        let air from their mouths under water.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Finally I found my
        bearings and was scurrying around getting ready for the
        day that lay before us. After about a half hour Andy
        emerged from his cocoon and was luckily greeted by
        Richard with his favorite morning words, &quot;would you
        like a cup of coffee?&quot; Andy managed to act
        surprised, but I distinctly remember him dropping huge
        hints to Richard about his coffee addiction around the
        camp fire.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The ferry was to leave at
        nine and I became a little nervous as Andy was scarcely
        ready and the motor was running, the gates were closed
        and all cars boarded. We made it aboard in plenty of
        time. It was a remarkably well equipped boat with a huge
        lounge and café suspended over the auto deck. As we
        purchased breakfast we watched the ferry pull away from
        the dock. We were a little shocked that we had to
        actually pay for this ferry. The coffee lady demanded ten
        Finnish Marks for each of us and an equal amount for our
        bikes, imagine, nearly four dollars for each of us? We
        were really offended after not having to pay for a single
        ferry the day before. We were sipping coffee and making
        plans for the day&#146;s ride as we left the chunk of
        rock we called home for a night.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Richard, Andy and I
        decided that we&#146;d make our way to an intriguing
        chain of islands called Brando. On the map it looked like
        they were scarcely wide enough for a road and looked like
        more water than island. The only issue would be that we
        had to make an amazingly tight set of ferry connections
        to get to the islands. This meant that we&#146;d have to
        land at one ferry dock, sprint to the other side of the
        Island and repeat the process a number of times. I
        couldn&#146;t see how this would be possible for Richard.
        He had all the right camping gear, but it was attached to
        a big ol&#146; three speed.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">My fears were soon
        allayed. I was cranking along at over 30kph on a slight
        uphill against a little breeze and looked in my little
        rearview mirror to see Richard drafting me and Andrew
        somewhere off in the distance. Richard was strong. On
        that same islelet we decided we must stop for a moment,
        Andy needed cash and we needed some lunch. Andy wrestled
        with the cash machine forever it seemed while Richard and
        I shot the breeze. Finally Andrew wandered up a little
        confused; he didn&#146;t know where we were and seemed a
        little perturbed that we were late and wouldn&#146;t make
        our ferry connections.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">It was looking a little
        tight as we got of the next ferry we had a scant 20
        minutes to make 8.5K in order to find Brando. Andy
        immediately declared it impossible. I felt a little
        worried, but perked up as I watched Richard go into turbo
        mode on his brown ugly three speed. He cranked up the
        little tough hills against the wind and whooshed down the
        hills past the pine trees, wheat fields, marshes, geese,
        swans. It made me very proud of him. I struggled to keep
        up and Andy trailed behind. We made the ferry with a few
        minutes to spare and were lounging in the ferry bar
        before we knew it.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">On the ride to Brando we
        ogled Finns of every age group banged on a gambling
        machine (a Finnish variety of the type that you put a
        coin in with the hope it will push more coins off into a
        tray) hoping that some coin would fall out. We munched
        our Salami sandwiches, tangerines and yogurt watching
        teeny isles pass by. The archipelago is astoundingly
        beautiful. Each island a chunk of rock that had been
        polished clean by the glaciers topped with a little soil
        and covered with pine trees.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Brando was actually a
        string of these little stones. Most places you could see
        the sea on either side. There was virtually no farming,
        few houses and only a few cars passed in over twenty
        kilometers (and then only within a few moments of our
        arrival by ferry). It&#146;s hard to describe this
        afternoon of perfect cycling. The chemistry of sun,
        breeze, vacant road, stunning scenery and great company.
        It only comes to you a few times in thousands of miles.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">We reached land&#146;s end
        only to find a hundred cars and an equal number of
        cyclists boarding the next ferry. Seems that we&#146;d
        arrived at the perfect moment, just in time to make our
        next destination. As we boarded the boat the operators
        were having a nervous breakdown over the number of
        bicycles. They wanted cycles of varying destinations in
        different piles and the young cyclists ahead of us were
        confused about their destination. So was Andrew. He
        thought that if we told them we were going to the near
        destination that we wouldn&#146;t have to pay and was
        trying to get us free passage (it turned out that this
        was for nothing, it was free regardless of destination).
        We finally put our bikes in the proper pile when one
        young girl almost lost it. Her bike was at the bottom of
        the pile of the bikes going to the wrong destination.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">We were finally settled in
        the cabin. I napped until the next destination, where
        Richard parted company. When we finally arrived at our
        &quot;final&quot; destination we got off the boat and let
        all of the ferry traffic pass. I was in a little shock
        over the flurry of activity. There were hundreds of
        cyclists, fast cars and badly driven busses. It was too
        much after our idyllic ride over Brando. On top of all of
        the activity, the hills became long and steep and the
        riding seemed tough after the morning&#146;s sprints from
        ferry to ferry.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The terrain chilled out
        and we spent the golden part of the day riding over
        gentle hills through wheat fields. Upon entering
        Mariehamn we noted that there was a huge
        &quot;redneck&quot; factor amongst the drivers. The all
        zipped around town burning rubber, racing their engines
        and blaring their stereos at full volume. We&#146;d not
        encountered such a phenomena since Florida. One driver
        even &quot;flipped us the bird&quot; as we entered the
        suburbs, the first time this had happened in my memory. I
        longed to be back on Brando.</font></p>

        to Helsinki, 134 km</b></font><p><font size="2" face="Arial">From Mariehamn we took another ferry, a big
        one this time, for the six-hour journey back to Turku. We
        booked passage on the Viking Line again, and the ship was
        identical to the one we had taken several days earlier.
        The weather was sultry and glorious, and standing on deck
        watching the myriad islands pass by felt like a dream.
        Some of them were so close you felt you could reach out
        and touch them. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Once in Turku, we headed
        straight for the train station. We had hoped to accept
        Torben and Piia&#146;s invitation to spend a night with
        them in Hameenlinna and ride down from there to Helsinki.
        But it was too late; there were no more rail connections
        for the day. It was Fred&#146;s turn to find us lodgings,
        and he was rightfully proud of himself for stumbling upon
        a truly excellent room. Our hotel had commissioned
        artists to design individual &quot;fantasy&quot; rooms,
        and we scored big time with the &quot;North Star&quot;
        room, in which all the bizarre furniture was handmade,
        including lamps made from kitchen implements and a
        telephone encrusted with jewel-like bumps. It was easily
        the most original hotel room either of us had ever stayed
        in (and this includes the &quot;Gypsy Rock&quot; room at
        the Madonna Inn in San Luis Obispo), and we were thrilled
        to have found it in such an unlikely place.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Turku was amazingly
        happening for a Thursday night. I suppose the hot weather
        forced everyone out of doors, because the sidewalks were
        packed with boisterous Finns. We stopped to rehydrate in
        a sidewalk café on the central square, where we were
        quickly joined at our table by an inebriated and slightly
        creepy dude called Johannis. He insisted on buying us a
        round (of cider) and tried to teach us some Finnish
        words, which was hopeless. When I learned that the
        Finnish word for &quot;eighty-eight&quot; is
        &quot;kahdeksankymmentakahdesksan,&quot; I abandoned any
        further desire to progress beyond the relatively simple
        &quot;kiitos&quot; (meaning thank you). Our conversation
        was interrupted at one point when a girl at a neighboring
        table stood up, swayed a bit, and vomited profusely as
        she made her way onto the sidewalk. We soon learned that
        this is completely acceptable behavior in Finland.
        Everyone else seated on the terrace took this display in
        stride; after only a couple of minutes a café employee
        came out with a bucket no doubt reserved for
        vomit-cleaning purposes and calmly washed the mess into
        the gutter. Fearing that Johannis would soon be following
        suit, we bid our host adieu.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">From here we moved on to a
        gay bar called &quot;Jack&#146;s and Mike&#146;s,&quot;
        whose butch female staff made it feel more like
        &quot;Jills and Dykes.&quot; We found a tiny table in a
        cramped corner, where we were soon joined by a trio of
        friendly Finns. Mari is a fantastically gorgeous blond
        creature, a straight girl who had fallen in love with a
        Turk on a recent trip to Bodrum; Franz is a
        forty-something architect who had designed a room at our
        hotel (but not ours); and Syrpa is a beautiful young
        lesbian in men&#146;s pants and into kink. All three of
        them were way hip without being self-concious about it,
        convincing Fred that we had fallen in with the creme de
        la creme of gay Turku. The five of us gabbed for hours,
        finishing the evening (no pun intended) at a heinous
        faux-Mexican joint full of drunk and horny heteros. Sure
        enough, our friend Johannis was there, but he was way too
        far gone to recognize us, let alone walk in a straight
        line. Realizing it was past two a.m., we excused
        ourselves and walked home through the sultry night air,
        amazed by the Finns&#146; seemingly unlimited capacity
        for partying. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Not surprisingly, it was
        hot again the next day. We had already decided to take a
        train part of the way to Helsinki, nearly two hundred
        kilometers away on a busy highway. The train was like a
        rolling Finnish sauna, so hot and airless it was. We
        shared our compartment with a large group of young
        Frenchies who &#150;judging by their appearance and
        odor&#151;had just spent an extended period of time
        camping in the wilderness. Boarding the train, one
        fifteen-year old girl shot us an accusatory glance and
        said to her friend, &quot;It stinks in here.&quot; I
        resisted retorting that unlike them, we had showered that
        morning. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">In less than an hour we
        were in the town of Salo, the alleged center of
        Finland&#146;s answer to Silicon Valley. It was here that
        I saw my first Nordic street person, while I waited for
        Fred to emerge from the grocery store. He looked and
        smelled like a homeless person anywhere, and the people
        passing him in the street acted shocked to see such a
        display of deviant behavior. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">It was a very hard
        day&#146;s pedal, with lots of hills, a deadly headwind,
        and temperatures hovering around 30 degrees Celsius. The
        stream of cars and trucks racing by us didn&#146;t help
        matters any, either. At least we found a shaded place by
        the side of a lake to have our picnic, where Fred tried
        his hardest to finish the kilo of yogurt he had
        purchased. After eating, I jumped into the brown water
        and thought I had found God. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The refreshing effect of
        the water didn&#146;t last long, however, and I began to
        worry about my dwindling and then non-existent water
        supply. As we pedaled past more lakes dotting the
        wilderness, the brown tannic water began to look more and
        more inviting, but this time as a beverage. I was on the
        verge of sticking my face into one and sucking sludge
        when a country store appeared out of nowhere, like a
        mirage in the desert. We were a disgusting sweaty mess,
        but the friendly proprietress gladly filled our water
        bottles, going so far as to stuff them with ice. Had she
        been sent by God? </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Near a town called Inkoo
        &#150;where we filled up our water bottles yet
        again&#151; we joined a high-speed highway that made the
        previous road look like a country lane. At least there
        was a shoulder, but the traffic combined with the wind,
        heat and road grit made the whole experience an
        unpleasant one. It was a long sixty-five more kilometers
        to Helsinki, made longer by a flat on my front tire. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Crossing Helsinki&#146;s
        ring road, we penetrated into what I thought would mark
        the beginnings of Finland&#146;s only metropolis. But
        what greeted us were many more miles of forest,
        moose-crossing signs, and a continuous stream of Volvo
        station wagons zooming towards the country for the
        weekend. When we finally reached what appeared to be
        suburbs, we began asking directions to Helsinki by bike
        (the divided highway being off-limits to cycles) and
        everyone looked at us as if we were asking how to get to
        China. Indeed, the capital was still very far away, and
        the route was poorly marked. By the time we finally
        reached what looked like a town, we were at the end of
        our tethers both physically and emotionally. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Arriving at our hotel just
        past nine p.m. I felt like I could go straight to bed and
        stay there for the weekend. But Olivier would be there in
        just a few hours and would surely want to hit the town.
        Our room was yet another Finnish sauna, as was the
        restaurant where we had dinner. Apparently Finland was
        experiencing a freak heat wave, with no air conditioning
        to be found anywhere. We chose a table directly below a
        fan, but found ourselves bathed in sweat from the mere
        effort of lifting a fork. Crossing a street on our way
        back, a middle-aged Finnish gentleman staggered over and
        berated us in English: &quot;You guys haven&#146;t had
        enough to drink.&quot; We looked around us and noticed
        that everyone else in the street was barely capable of
        walking, and that belches and farts and puking sounds
        resounded loudly, practically echoing in the streets. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Olivier showed up right on
        schedule, excited to be in such an alien place and
        anxious to investigate its nightlife. Before leaving the
        room, he unscrewed one of the windows in order to let
        more air in, but it didn&#146;t help much. The walk over
        to Helsinki&#146;s biggest queer disco (&quot;Don&#146;t
        tell Mama&quot;, which was predictably stifling), was
        like a hallucination, with so many drunken young Finns
        swaying and barfing in the street. Had we stepped into
        another dimension?</font></p>

        faces are topped with antenas: tiny cute wool hat for the

        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">By night it becomes nuts;
        welcome to hell sink in. They already start in the

        drunk roach motel. Geography says 10% of Finland is
        covered by water but it&#146;s filled up of 90% of vodka,
        and out of that 90%, 2O% is recycled into a Baltic
        version of Niagara Falls of puke, the result of a
        decadent ballet of &quot;absolut&quot; excess. With good
        humor, they combine to create an exceptionally smooth
        ,rounded flavor with a delicate aroma and a well-balanced
        finish. Experience it.</font></p>
