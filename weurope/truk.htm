        Portsmouth to Lewes, 57k</b></font><p><font size="2" face="Arial">Whether it&#146;s by plane, boat or train,
        my arrival in England is always met with the same
        impression: what a dreary and shabby place this is. Even
        under blue skies &#150;as was the case as we pedaled into
        Portsmouth&#151;there is an overwhelming sense of
        grayness. Square brick buildings covered in soot, the
        1930&#146;s aesthetic of the storefronts, and the ashen
        complexions and expressions of the people --all
        contribute to the feeling of being in a world with all
        the color sucked out of it. It almost looks as if
        they&#146;re still digging out of aftermath of the Blitz.
        Could this bleak and depressing place really have been
        the center of a vast empire?</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The nine-hour boat ride
        had passed without incident. The channel was smooth as
        glass, so I didn&#146;t get to see Fred change colors and
        barf. We spent most of the time napping in our cabin and
        wandering around the deserted decks, staring off into the
        fog. Once in Portsmouth, our mission was to find a place
        to spend the night. The sun was hanging low in the sky,
        and we didn&#146;t want to get caught in the dark. Of
        course, it would remain light for another four hours at
        this Northern latitude, but the sense of urgency was
        heightened by continuing problems with my front tire. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Now that we were in an
        English-speaking country, it was Fred&#146;s job to take
        care of the negotiations involved in securing lodging. It
        wasn&#146;t easy for him though, since all the hotels we
        stopped at were either full or bicycle-intolerant. I felt
        frustrated being on such an unattractive, unfriendly
        island full of linguistically and orthographically
        challenged people, who spell color with a &quot;u&quot;
        and pronounce &quot;whining&quot; &quot;win-jing.&quot;
        After three or four unsuccessful attempts at securing
        lodgings, I began whinging &quot;where&#146;s the
        motel?&quot; Even though the day had been anything but
        athletically challenging, I was tired of stopping every
        ten minutes for a bout of sisyphian pumping, and wanted
        nothing so much as to roll my bike into a ground floor
        room at the nearest Ramada Inn, soak in a hot bath and
        lose my brain to 125 channels of cable t.v. The
        receptionist at one fully-booked hotel called around and
        found us a room in a bed-&#145;n&#146;-breakfast sorta
        place in the suburbs. To get there we rode along a
        seaside promenade which had clearly enjoyed its heyday
        during the reign of Victoria Regina (say that six times
        fast). Of course we had to unload our bikes completely
        and lug everything up a narrow staircase under the
        disapproving eyes of the hotel&#146;s owner to our little
        room full of beds and tea-making apparatus.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Once settled in, we struck
        off in search of a meal. Our perpetually unreliable
        Spartacus Guide led us to a non-existent homo café at
        the intersection of Albert Road and Victoria Road.
        Nearby, however, we found a pubfull of people eating and
        we ventured in only to learn they were no longer serving;
        would we like a beer? I was beginning to suspect that
        Portsmouth had been engineered to alienate American
        cycletourists. These suspicions were confirmed when we
        found that the only place serving food after nine p.m. in
        Portsmouth was&#133; a carry-out fish and chips shack.
        Back in our room, Fred somehow managed to polish off his
        cod, but I couldn&#146;t face my haddock, and threw it in
        the trash can, feeling perversely satisfied that
        we&#146;d leave our overpriced and unfriendly
        accommodations smelling of fish and old grease.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">As the reader might have
        surmised by now, neither Fred nor I are rabid
        anglophiles. But the morning nearly converted us, when we
        made our way downstairs to indulge in the second feature
        offered by our bed &#145;n&#146; breakfast. The huge
        helpings of eggs, sausages, tomatoes, mushrooms, cereals,
        fruit and pastries came as a welcome change from the
        sparse continental breakfasts we&#146;d been enduring.
        For the first time in nearly a month, we felt properly
        fortified for a day of riding. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Before we could set off,
        however, I had my flat tire to tend to. The Portsmouth
        Cycle Exchange is located at the now-familiar
        intersection of Victoria and Albert Roads, and is well
        worth the detour if you ever get the chance. A skinny,
        geeky-looking guy called Derek gave me heaps of sage
        advice on wheel repair. Of course, I only understood
        about a quarter of what he said. His waxy gnome-like
        co-worker spoke more clearly, though, and told me how
        much he loved Americans, finding them gracious and
        optimistic. I told him I liked Americans, too, yet
        withheld comment when he began to complain about people
        studying &quot;useless&quot; things like art and
        literature in school. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Next on our list of tasks
        was to find a map. This was accomplished in the
        &quot;precinct&quot; (Britannic for pedestrian mall),
        where Fred was accosted by an unfriendly old Brit in a
        linen suit while I was inside a bookshop. The man
        apparently came up to him complaining that Fred was
        taking his usual place on a park bench. As we pedaled off
        a couple of minutes later, he shouted after us, &quot;No
        cycling allowed!&quot;, to which we responded by waving
        and smiling.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Getting out of Portsmouth
        was a total nightmare. The only highway out of town was
        solid with speeding metal death canisters, all driving on
        the wrong side of the road. A sorry excuse for a bike
        path ran intermittently alongside it, its surface no
        longer suitable for riding &#150;a legacy of the endless
        Thatcherism that has strangled the life out of this
        little island country? My panniers being brushed by the
        uninterupted stream of automobiles, I hoped that the new
        Blair administration would have more cycle-friendly
        policies. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Making matters worse was
        the wind, perhaps the strongest we&#146;ve encountered on
        the trip. It was coming straight out of the East (the
        direction we were headed, bien sur) and gusted up to
        forty miles an hour. That&#146;s what the weather report
        said anyway, and we didn&#146;t doubt it once we were out
        in the countryside, pedaling with all our might <u>down</u>
        hills. The countryside looked green and attractive
        &#150;as the English countryside is meant to&#151;but
        even on the secondary roads, the traffic continued to be
        a menace, so all our concentration was focused on staying
        alive in the leftmost part of the road.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Our goal for lunch was
        Chichester, which looked close on the map. But with the
        wind and our frustration with the drivers, we were
        exhausted by the time we stopped there for a lunch of a
        salad with &quot;brown sauce&quot; and a stuffed potato.
        We decided to take the train to Brighton, only a few
        miles from Susannah&#146;s house in Lewes and the
        supposed gay capital of Britain. The train was filled
        with noisy packs of schoolchildren in uniform. Many of
        them had bicycles, too, and we liked how accommodating
        the rail system was to cyclists &#150;much more so than
        the roads, anyway.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Brighton is a big town, we
        discovered quickly, and an irritatingly hilly one. Of
        course all the traffic moved along at unbelievable
        speeds, putting our lives in jeapordy, but I insisted we
        check out the beach and sample the queer scene there. We
        stopped at an outdoor café on a traffic-clogged cliff,
        where we met an avid cyclist called Spike, who used his
        bike not only as a means of conveyance but also as a sort
        of mobile petting zoo. He carried two small dogs
        &#150;Tish and Teabag&#151;in his handlebar bag, while
        his cockatoo (Sam) used the bars as a perch. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">We thought we&#146;d take
        the scenic route to Lewes, but wimped out yet again,
        ostensibly due to the increasingly threatening skies. The
        main road was a horror, but had a mostly usable bike lane
        running alongside it. It went up and over a series of
        steep bald hills called &quot;downs&quot; &#150;one of
        those very specific Britannic geographical features, like
        heath and weald and moor. Lewes itself was predictably
        traffic-clogged, but otherwise adorable. It didn&#146;t
        take us long to find Susannah and Jonathan&#146;s little
        house, where we caught up on each other&#146;s lives over
        tea and scones.</font></p>

        <td><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>Hiatus - London 6-8
        June</b></font><p><font size="2" face="Arial">Owen, Max
        and Myriem&#146;s son, was having a little tantrum when
        we arrived in London. Still a little cranky following his
        afternoon nap. Once he shook off his mood he engaged me
        in a conversation describing his exploits at school, his
        possessions and relations with his sister, Octavia,
        sitting at the dining room table. I was surprised to
        discover how he&#146;d developed since I&#146;d last seen
        him. Now but three and one-half years old with what
        seemed to be an enormous vocabulary, great diction and an
        astounding command of grammar. It felt great to be in Max
        and Myriem&#146;s home rather than in a hotel. The
        children, though a constant distraction, made it all the
        more rich an experience.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">London had undergone a
        change since my last visit. In the past it had always
        seemed a sad post imperialist place full of pretentious
        idiots and woefully overpriced. Now it was not sad. There
        seemed to be an infectious energy in the air that I
        associate with highly prosperous cities at the apex of
        their accomplishment. I had the sense that London was
        enjoying a highpoint in their history and economy.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Largely our time there
        together with Max, Myriem and family was spent catching
        up on the time that had past since we had last seen one
        another. Parenthood seems to agree with our friends who
        now glowed while speaking about or playing with their
        children. And for good reason, Owen and Octavia are
        enough to make anyone proud. We had the best intention of
        visiting Dante at the set of the film he is producing,
        but never made it. We actually got on the subway and
        found our way to where we though they were filming only
        to discover that Andrew had made a rare navigation error
        as to the location of the shoot.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">One night we did escape
        for an ultimate luxury. We actually went to see a movie.
        Kronenberg&#146;s &quot;Crash&quot; was more than a
        little disappointing. Afterwards a creepy little Asian
        guy followed me into the bathroom and tried to flirt with
        me. My rebuff there seemed to not be enough punishment
        for him so he followed us down the street until he caught
        us and invited us collectively to come with him to his
        house in Brixton. He insisted on finding a piece of paper
        and giving us his number. Promptly told us might not work
        due to some personal problems he was having at the
        moment. Somehow the note found the trash can within a few
        yards of our encounter. We toyed with the idea of a night
        out at Heaven (the Disneyland of Queerdom) but
        couldn&#146;t muster enough energy and retired to our
        host&#146;s house for a good night&#146;s rest before
        going to Paris.</font></p>

        off the train at the Gare du Nord felt like coming home,
        like slipping into an old and comfortable pair of shoes.
        I loved the sense of knowing where I was going without
        the aid of a map for a change. Even the smell in the
        metro downstairs seemed cozy in its familiarity. It
        didn&#146;t take long to get to Olivier&#146;s apartment,
        which he had recently redecorated to look like a tent.
        Unfortunately, Olivier wasn&#146;t in the mood to go out
        with us, since he was suffering from an abscessed tooth
        which made it look like he had secreted a grapefruit in
        his gumline.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Most of my nine days in
        Paris were spent visiting friends and getting
        reacquainted with my former home. Highlights included
        playing petanques in front of the Louvre with Olivier and
        Francois, dinner in Chinatown with Angela and her two
        amazing daughters, and brunch at Damien&#146;s house with
        most of the people who used to come by for brunches at
        Rue Montmartre and Rue du Temple. Our trip mascot Geoff
        Benson showed up, in Paris for a couple of days before
        heading back to the States for the Lori &#145;n&#146;
        Paul wedding extravaganza, which Fred will describe
        below&#133;</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>Hiatus - London, 14-15
        June</b> </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">On this visit I&#146;d
        spend more time with my longtime friend Dante, staying
        with him in the thick of things, the center of Soho. Here
        he is producing his first feature film (I am frightfully
        proud of him). We had dinner with his boss and friend
        Tony Edwards at their exclusive downtown club, the Soho
        House. Every time I see Tony I am struck by how
        down-to-earth he is. It seems surprising to me how little
        he has changed despite his meteoric success on TV.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">We managed to hit a few
        pubs and sample London&#146;s gay culture together. Found
        one especially fun venue called Freedom. A little bar and
        café that was infected with the same energy that seemed
        to pervade all of London. It was unlike the sad little
        pubs we visited where folks seemed more intent on getting
        drunk and laid than anything else. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Dante and Tony invited me
        to a hilarious event, the Stella Artois Tennis Finals, a
        warm-up for Wimbledon. It was the first time I&#146;d
        gone to such an event. There was a star-studded luncheon
        beforehand. Never had I felt more out of place. My outfit
        was cobbled together from odds and ends around
        Dante&#146;s house and from my bike bags. Everyone else
        around me was amazingly put together. The host was
        wearing an especially dapper periwinkle blazer. People
        were gabbing about their latest film projects and name
        dropping while I sulked quietly. Everyone was awed by
        Pierce (Brosman) who swaggered about wearing DG
        sunglasses that would have been at home on Jackie O. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">It was an afternoon of
        firsts for me. I&#146;d never seen tennis played on grass
        in person either. Our seats were spectacular. At the
        baseline one row back. We felt like we could reach down
        and touch Mark Philipousas (something I have dreamed
        about since seeing him). I learned to fear him when he
        served from the other side of the court. He propelled
        tennis balls at Ivansevich at speeds averaging 120mph.
        The linesmen and I flinched each time the first service
        flamed over the net in our direction. At one point
        Ivansevich realized the absurdity of trying to actually
        return it and made the ball-girl return Mark&#146;s
        service for a point. The ball-girl and Philipousas made
        some sport of it and the longest rally of the game
        ensued. (thankfully) Dante wanted to leave before the
        doubles final.</font></p>

        departure from San Diego that I had seen my mom, Doris.
        And, then we&#146;d had precious few moments alone
        together. So it was only right to plan to spend some time
        together during our hiatus. I&#146;d planned to go to
        Wilmington to see two dear friends' wedding so it was
        convenient for us to meet in New York. Mom faced visiting
        New York City with great trepidation. I made the trek out
        to the airport to meet her in order to alleviate some her
        fear. She recounted to me her adventures shopping in NYC
        thirty years before as we made our way into town.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">I didn&#146;t give her
        much time to rest. Just after checking into the hotel I
        whisked her off to dinner at Judson Grill. After a
        satisfying meal we both enjoyed &quot;Master Class&quot;
        featuring the exploits of Maria Callas as a singing
        instructor. Thus began my triple life in NYC; hanging
        with mom, working on the computer and seeing my friends.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">After dropping her at the
        hotel I headed back to Mike&#146;s pad to work on backing
        up our computer. I wrestled with the software and tape
        drive for two consecutive nights before having some
        success. This night I tore my hair out until well after
        one a.m. Afterwards the Barracuda Bar beckoned. I was to
        meet my friend Davey. He&#146;d just moved to New York
        and is doing time as a bartender while getting his
        business off the ground. Thankfully the bar was empty and
        we capitalized on that opportunity to catch up. David
        Booz is amazing. He seems ageless and Buddha-like in
        demeanor. I didn&#146;t manage to retire to bed until
        after three, wandering back to Mike&#146;s wondering how
        David can manage to work until four in the morning.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">For me the morning came
        very early. I was at my mom&#146;s hotel around nine
        breakfasting and planning another day together. We made a
        booking to see &quot;The Gin Game&quot; revival and set
        off to the Metropolitan Museum to see the Cartier show.
        The Cartier expo was sparkling and colorful. I found it
        especially remarkable that Cartier made some many pieces
        of jewelry for stock. He would just wake up one day and
        say to himself &quot;Oh, think I&#146;ll put together a
        200 carat diamond tiara to put in a display case. Maybe a
        prince or someone will happen in and plunk down the
        national debt for it?!&quot; Doris dug all the sapphires
        and other colored gems that were simply polished and set
        rather than cut. I could only imagine Marilyn Monroe
        saying &quot;I love finding new places to wear
        diamonds!&quot;</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Lunch was disappointing
        for me. I had booked the Grammercy Tavern anticipating a
        fine meal. Our appetizers were &quot;spot-on&quot; as was
        the &#146;90 white burgundy we shared. Unfortunately my
        main course arrived with more dirt than mushrooms
        adorning the fish. It was the first time in ages I&#146;d
        sent a meal back to the kitchen. The waiter was
        unapologetic, explaining that they don&#146;t wash this
        type of mushroom, they merely brush off the dirt. This
        was supposed to make me more comfortable. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Mom loved &quot;The Gin
        Game&quot; while I found it hard to believe. Again that
        night I worked on the computer until late and then met
        friends for drinks. By the third day of this hectic
        schedule I was near collapse. Somehow I managed to make
        it up to breakfast where we planned our day. Shopping,
        tea at Mike's, dinner with Geoff Benson and &quot;Full
        Gallop&quot;. While mom hit Bergdorf&#146;s and
        Sak&#146;s I ran around town picking up odds and ends to
        refill my paniers.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Ironically I&#146;d missed
        Geoff by minutes in Paris, but here he was in New York.
        Rough and ready for adventure and Lori and Paul&#146;s
        wedding. He joined me and my mom for a noodlishious meal
        before the play and we all laughed at the monologue
        detailing the post Vogue days of Diana Vreeland. All of
        us wondered if she actually wore that much rouge in
        person. We were all very curious to know how many
        syllables there were in the words &quot;Paaahrissss&quot;
        and &quot;Jaaahpaaahn&quot; after hearing her speak them.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Mom departed the next day.
        I was really proud and relieved that she made it to the
        airport unescorted. It had been a fun whirlwind in New
        York with her.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Geoff and I barely made
        our train to Wilmington. The Friday traffic in Manhattan
        was gridlocked and we stepped aboard just as the doors
        closed and the coaches began to move. Both of us were
        exhausted from the evening before and our days on
        &quot;vacation&quot;. Somehow I managed to sleep along
        the way though the car was packed. We arrived in a town
        that must have been the testing ground of the neutron
        bomb. Friday at 6pm: no one was on the streets of
        downtown.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">In Wilmington Geoff and I
        assumed the roles of social directors. We&#146;d arranged
        dinner with Te that night, drinks with the wedding party
        and our friends and a brunch for the folks not in the
        ceremony on the wedding day. A dirty job, but someone had
        to do it. The cocktail party in the bar was most amusing.
        Te&#146;s champagne-inspired alter ego appeared that
        night, Trixie Bubbles. She was making trouble, goading
        perfectly innocent young ladies into picking up on preppy
        boys at the bar, giggling at their antics and predicting
        the results of social interactions with astounding
        accuracy. She wasn&#146;t alone in alcohol inspired
        levity. Marie Huwe managed to power down a few toddies
        herself and revealed very embarrassing tales of her days
        in college. We thoughtfully reminded her of them for the
        next two days. None of us will forget her visceral
        description of life in her sorority. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The wedding itself was an
        impressive affair in a garden outside of Wilmington. The
        only sad part was that I couldn&#146;t hear the Bride and
        Groom exchange their vows and thoughts. Paul and Lori
        held an inspiring party afterwards. In a tent on a great
        lawn they stuffed us with food and libations, entertained
        us with music and provided us with fantastically diverse
        guests with which to converse. It was like a five year
        high school reunion for me. I had the chance to catch up
        with all of my friends from Borland who have now all
        landed elsewhere. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The wedding ended early.
        I&#146;ve become accustomed to French weddings that last
        until dawn. Geoff, Te, Marie, Paul, Lori and many others
        were standing around talking while the waiters folded the
        chairs and tables looking at us crossly. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Afterwards Geoff and I hit
        the local Wilmington homo hangout conveniently located
        just outside the hotel. A quick first look revealed
        nothing of interest and we almost left immediately. Just
        before making our way back I saw someone lurking in the
        dark with his friends near the dance floor. At the same
        time Geoff found a friend who was rumored to have chest
        implants and was the talk of the bar for that reason.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Brunch the next day was a
        comedy for everyone but the Maitre d&#146; Hotel of the
        restaurant. Someone had made a reservation for 6-8 folks
        not realizing that nearly the entire California
        contingent of the wedding was to be there. Eight became
        ten, ten became twelve&#133;. All the while our host was
        rearranging tables. Final count was 18 or so, and to
        their credit the wait staff and host accommodated all of
        us happily.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Afterwards Geoff and I
        were off to NYC. At the train station while we watched
        Amtrak have a schedule meltdown I arranged a dinner
        party. I also managed to invite my Wilmington friend to
        join me in NYC. That night Davey, his buddy Javier,
        Geoff, Lee and I had a dinner of gnocchi, salad and ice
        cream. I was super unsatisfied with the gnocchi. Somehow
        it came out with a consistency resembling chewing gum. I
        can&#146;t imagine how anyone there managed to eat it.
        But everyone seemed to eat it without complaint (polite
        or what?)</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The next day my stateside
        voyage had come to an end. Lee departed for the train and
        I headed for the airport after a last minute shopping
        spree with Geoff. Somehow I ended up at the wrong
        airport. Luckily the check-in clerk was able to alter my
        ticket and got me to Dulles for my connection. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Normally I would have
        freaked out to find a hysterical two-year-old next to me
        on the flight to London. I had visions of not sleeping a
        wink on the way back. Instead I helped Sam&#146;s mother
        calm him down and entertained him while his mother got
        settled on the plane. He turned out to be very
        entertaining and ultimately crashed early enough for me
        to get some sleep and see the movie. Arriving in London
        again I was relieved knowing that I&#146;d be back on my
        cycle within a few days.</font></p>

        <td><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>Vienna 18-24 June</b></font><p><font size="2" face="Arial">It was an amazing week spent with
        my little son, and a week which zoomed by way too
        quickly. My first few days there, Caspar was still
        getting over a nasty bout of croup, so we spent most of
        the time indoors, reading books, playing and napping. He
        was feeling better when Olivier and his mom showed up,
        which allowed us to babysit and sightsee simultaneously.
        Though I had been to Vienna many times before, this
        marked my first visit to the amazing Belvedere palace and
        museum --which houses the most famous works by Shiele and
        Klimt-- and the Schatzkammer, where the Hapsburg family
        jewels are on display. We also made an excursion into the
        countryside with Antonia&#146;s disarmingly charming
        friend Alexander. Caspar especially enjoyed our ride on
        the Riesenrad --the ferris-wheel-like symbol of Vienna--
        a horse and buggy tour of Vienna&#146;s monument-rich
        center, picking flowers and playing in the parks, and
        meeting dogs and old ladies in the many cafés we
        visited. All in all, it was a perfect week, and I
        didn&#146;t get on a bicycle seat once. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">As always, I was struck by
        how conservative Vienna is. It&#146;s as if the Austrian
        capital (some say all of Austria) has been frozen in
        time, since most of the architecture, attitudes and even
        fashions evoke the turn of the century. It also strikes
        me as the oldest European capital in the demographic
        sense, with countless little old ladies and men doddering
        around in their feathered hats and woolen outfits. Even
        the town&#146;s best homo bar, the café Savoy, seems
        incredibly staid and proper, complete with a
        septuagenarian cocktail waiter in a vest and bowtie.
        While Vienna is very pleasant to visit, cozy and opulent
        at the same time, I could never live there for the
        oppressively established social mores. I wonder if
        anything will have changed by the time that Caspar
        &#150;who at fifteen months has spent more time there
        than I have&#151;grows up and learns to appreciate such
        things.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>Europride and Eurostar,
        25-26 June</b></font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">It is never easy saying
        goodbye to the little critter, and if it weren&#146;t for
        his mom I&#146;d bungee him on to my bike and bring him
        along. I could think of little else as we flew over the
        Alps and back to Paris. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">We didn&#146;t get in
        until late and the weather was totally disgusting, but I
        felt obligated to go out since it was my last night in
        Paris and my only chance to get a flavor of
        &quot;Europride.&quot; Europride is a recently
        established annual homo extravaganza that takes place in
        a different European capital every June. In Paris it was
        expected to attract no fewer than 300,000 people, and I
        was determined to see the impact this would have on the
        all too familiar homo trail through Les Halles and Le
        Marais. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">As expected, I felt stupid
        for having committed myself to being in England the next
        day. What lousy scheduling. For Europride promised to be
        an extraodinary event. The bars and cafes were packed
        with Europeans from all over, especially the more
        strident, militant types from Northern countries --just
        what uptight Paris needs to shake it up a little. Never
        before have I been addressed in Danish by a stranger in a
        French queer bar. I wished I had been able to stay on for
        a few days.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Nevertheless, I boarded
        the Eurostar early the next morning, toting my outfit for
        that evening&#146;s opera. It was my fourth trip on the
        famed train, and I have always found it the perfect
        emblem of European so-called unity. In France, the train
        zooms at an average speed of 300 kilometers (that&#146;s
        186 miles) per hour, while in England it drops down to 80
        (that&#146;s 50 miles per hour, a speed I have attained
        on my bicycle). </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">When the train ground to
        an unscheduled stop, I looked out the window and was
        amused to find myself in a place called Dulwich. It
        seemed a fitting name in the relentless gray rain, and
        looked appropriately bleak. In Waterloo station (another
        irony of the French train on English soil is the name of
        the station at which it terminates), I was struck by a
        sign indicating &quot;H.M. Immigration Inspector&quot;,
        the first bit presumably referring to the queen. What
        would she be doing with an immigration inspector, I
        wondered. Since it was raining and I was carrying a suit,
        I treated myself to a cab, one of the black ones which
        surely mark the summit of Britannic civilization. The
        driver was so friendly and helpful that I wondered if he
        had undergone some sort of affability training. Later
        that day, I learned that he had. All London cabbies go
        through a vigorous two-year&#146;s training called
        &quot;The Knowledge,&quot; in which they are required to
        learn the location of every single street in greater
        London, or so Max says anyway. The drive to Max&#146;s
        house was basically the route followed by tourist busses,
        past the houses of Parliament, Westminster Abbey and
        throngs of Sony-wielding Japanese under umbrellas in
        front of Buckingham Palace. Near Tony Blair&#146;s new
        digs my eyes fell upon a sign posted on a fence saying:
        &quot;BICYCLES WILL BE REMOVED BY POLICE,&quot; making me
        wonder once again what the Brits have against bicycles.
        It made me anxious to get to Holland&#133;</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">No one was home at
        Max&#146;s so I sat dripping on his building&#146;s
        doorstep until a workman let me in with more than a hint
        of suspicion in his eyes. I waited for a while on the
        staircase before Valentine, the au pair, arrived with
        Owen. Only a moment later I heard another familiar voice
        in the stairway that made my heart beat a little faster.
        It was Fred, whom I hadn&#146;t seen in two weeks. I had
        half forgotten that I was going to see him that day and
        it sent a happy shiver up my spine knowing that we&#146;d
        be together on the road again in only a day. Our hiatus
        was officially coming to an end.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Of course we were late
        getting to the opera at Glyndebourne. While we left
        London with time to spare, the traffic leaving the city
        was nightmarish under the pouring rain; it took two hours
        just to reach the freeway, by which time the curtain for
        the first act was on the verge of being raised. The
        ushers snuck us in (along with, let it be stated for the
        record, scores of other late arrivals) between the first
        and second acts. I noted with irony that the last time I
        had been to see &quot;The Marriage of Figaro&quot; I had
        to leave at the precise same moment in the opera,
        afflicted with a meningitis attack. Susannah was
        wonderful, of course, as was the rest of the cast and the
        production in general. And the intermission was nearly as
        entertaining as the music, since Glyndebourne is a
        serious social scene, with a famous ninety-minute
        &quot;interval&quot; in which upper-class British-type
        people picnic and pose in their finery. Susannah had told
        me that the dress-up aspect of Glyndebourne was
        &quot;like going to the senior prom&quot; and Antonia had
        described it as &quot;camp.&quot; I found both
        descriptions accurate. We saw famous people in tuxes and
        gowns, foreign dignitaries in their national drag,
        retired colonels with all their medals pinned to their
        chests, and the world&#146;s most ancient ushers all
        milling about among the fields of grass and sheep,
        looking for dry patches under the eaves in which to squat
        and nibble. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">After the opera, we went
        straight back to Susannah&#146;s place, only five minutes
        away. Hubby Jonathan greeted us at the door and prepared
        tea for us all, but soon headed upstairs for bed since he
        was beat from a tough week of rehearsing a play in which
        he plays a gay guy. He was sporting a goatee and a homo
        haircut and had been spending evenings conducting
        &quot;research&quot; in homo bars. It required enormous
        effort to restrain myself from teasing.</font></p>

        Dingleden, 64K</b></font><p><font size="2" face="Arial">After
        but a few days off our bikes in London I had already
        longed to hit the road again. Still unsure of what I am
        addicted to. Is it the movement, the excitement of
        meeting people or the chemicals my body produces?
        Whatever it is, my want had faded this day. What cut my
        desire to move? Could it be that the sky was gray and
        cold? That huge amounts of precipitation were falling
        from it? Or was it Susannah&#146;s comfortable little
        cottage in Lewes? Susannah didn&#146;t make it any easier
        to leave. As we were making final preparation for
        departure she uttered softly, &quot;naaaappp&quot; as
        though invoking a post hypnotic suggestion. Several times
        we almost fell to her hospitality, but at just before
        three we set off. Not before I managed to demonstrate,
        yet again, my propensity to have accidents. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Our bicycles had been
        stored high up in Susannah and Jonathon&#146;s yard under
        tarps. I uncovered mine and untangled it from the vines
        that had wrapped themselves around the wheels. I made it
        down the first flight of cement stairs safely resting for
        a few moments at the second level of the garden. The
        second flight was more narrow, constructed of brick and
        had slender steps. One side of the stair was bordered by
        a structure in the neighbor&#146;s yard and the other by
        a retaining wall and then the kitchen of the house. Three
        steps down my right foot lost traction and then the left.
        I let go of the bike and surfed the wild staircase on my
        left hip the bike left propped between the retaining wall
        and the little structure.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">A huge strawberry began to
        form on my upper leg as we rode off towards Dingleden to
        see Susy&#146;s mom. Again we felt menaced by
        britannotraffic leaving Lewes. So much so that as rain
        began to fall more heavily we pushed on instead of
        turning back, not wanting to re-experience Lewes&#146;
        uninviting roads. The pathways became quieter as we
        pressed on towards Kent. It seemed that as the roads
        became quieter they became correspondingly hillier. Our
        chests heaved pumping up the steep inclines past green
        pastures, under wooded canopies and through charming
        little villages. One feature of British country roads is
        their startlingly poor drainage. Water and mud flooded
        the roads leaving us covered with dirt and water.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Both Andy and I had read
        Bill Bryson&#146;s &quot;Lost Continent&quot; during our
        break. It was surprisingly accurate in its portrayal of
        the brits. Just like his book we found that asking
        directions yielded long responses that were virtually
        unintelligible and relayed more unrelated information
        than assistance. If there are two or more British people
        present when instructions were given each person
        dutifully gave their version and told about how their
        cousin or brother always gets lost just past the
        &quot;little pub along the great hedgerow near Big
        Fluffing while on their way to see the cinema in
        Cheesebury.&quot; The last yards were the most
        challenging. A huge lake had formed on a low point of
        Ann&#146;s unpaved driveway. I envisioned Andy falling in
        and becoming covered with mud. <i>(This would titillate
        one of our readers who wrote us during our break. He
        wanted to know if we had rescued a man from mud or
        quicksand along the way and if we had pictures. I wrote
        back asking if he had a fetish, and if so, to send a
        picture. His answer was &quot;yes&quot;. He included a
        photo of himself knee deep in mud wearing a speedo.) </i>Unfortunately
        for our reader, Andy safely made the crossing.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Knocking on the front door
        we were confronted with oh-so-calm Ann
        uncharacteristically worried. She anticipated that we
        would arrive earlier. So did we, but we had stopped
        frequently to warm up. After soiling Ann with our hugs
        hello Andy went directly to the bath while Ann and I
        caught up over a glass of red wine. We&#146;d stayed an
        afternoon there the year before following Susannah&#146;s
        wedding to Jonathan. That day the sun had beamed and I
        had napped in the sun. This day I bundled myself in my
        fleece riding gear and listened to the sheep bleat
        &quot;goodnight.&quot; After washing up we enjoyed the
        feast that Ann unfurled for us. Her hospitality was
        phenomenal. </font></p>

        Dingleden to Ramsgate and Dunkerque, France, 97km</b></font><p><font size="2" face="Arial">Leaving Anne&#146;s cozy country
        cottage is not an easy thing to do, especially when
        it&#146;s drizzling outside. So it was past noon when we
        finally hit the trail. The first miles were as tough as
        the previous day&#146;s, on narrow, curvy and steep
        country lanes. We&#146;d hardly begun riding when we got
        caught in an enormous sheep-jam, where we discovered that
        bikes are a great way to round up the bleating beasts.
        Fred asked the shepherd for a half day&#146;s wages when
        we wheeled by.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Rural England is
        definitely more appealing than urban England, and I found
        myself enjoying the day&#146;s riding in spite of myself.
        The weather cleared up and the Kentish countryside looked
        incredibly green as we pedaled towards Canterbury. We had
        lunch in a pub that served gnocchi (that&#146;s what they
        called it, anyway) before pumping up an endless hill that
        took us once again to the top of an gargantuan ridge that
        the Brits refer to as &quot;The Weald.&quot; From the
        top, it was mostly downhill to the nerve center of the
        Holy Anglican Empire.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">I knew that Canterbury
        would be full of tourists but wasn&#146;t prepared for
        the masses of camera-toting humanity that clogged the
        ancient town&#146;s narrow streets. It took us a long
        time to push our steeds through blocks and blocks of
        souvenir stands and mobs of American retirees asking
        their guides embarrassingly uninformed questions about
        Chaucer. I was shocked to find that admission was being
        charged to get into the &quot;cathedral precinct.&quot;
        Between the two of us, we had just enough coins to cover
        one person&#146;s hefty two-pounds-fifty entrance fee. I
        felt sort of obligated to make the pilgrimage as a
        baptized Episcopalian, though, and since Fred showed no
        interest at all in seeing the cathedral, I left him to
        watch the bikes. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">It was pretty impressive.
        I especially liked the shrine commemorating the Catholic
        church that had stood there before Henry VIII had it
        destroyed. It reminded me of the absurd silliness of
        Anglicanism, how it was founded by a bitter and
        vainglorious king Henry when Rome wouldn&#146;t grant him
        a divorce. The cathedral itself is an architectural
        hodgepodge, curiously asymmetrical and multi-leveled.
        There were tons of tombs of Very Important People,
        commemorative plaques everywhere, and a serious shrine to
        Thomas Beckett (additional admission fee required).
        Notably lacking were all my favorite Catholic motifs:
        smoking votive candles, elaborately carved confessionals
        and garish paintings of the Holy Virgin and bleeding
        Jesuses. Fascinating as the place was, it felt great to
        get back out into the sunlight again.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">There was another hill on
        our way out of town, but the remaining 25 kilometers to
        Ramsgate were possibly the most beautiful we cycled in
        England. Everything looked fresh and clean from all the
        rain and the air had a distinct sea-smell to it. We ran
        into a couple of Dutch cyclists in a tiny village. The
        guy was tall and thin and had one of those
        unpronounceable Dutch names that sounds like you have a
        chicken bone lodged in your throat. His younger wife (I
        presume) was mercifully named Elizabeth and offered us
        some bland biscuity things she called cookies. They had
        just arrived in England from the continent and were
        thrilled by the glorious weather. We clued them in that
        this was a very recent phenomenon indeed, and that
        banking on its continuation might not be a good idea, and
        reminded them to ride on the left side of the road. I
        wondered as we talked to them if we were missing the last
        boat to Oostende in Belgium.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">And of course we were. We
        followed a painless route into Ramsgate and had no
        trouble finding the ferry port. The next boat to Oostende
        (and yes, it was the last one for the day) was leaving in
        ten minutes, but the ticket agent told us we were too
        late and the boat was full anyway; how about Dunkerque,
        only 50 kilometers south of Oostende? He was remarkably
        friendly, saying he&#146;d give us a student discount and
        let us use his phone to call France for sleeping
        arrangements. Anxious to get back onto the continent,
        where the cars drive on the right and proper side of the
        road, we acquiesced immediately. The boat wasn&#146;t for
        another couple of hours, so we&#146;d have time for a
        delicious yet excruciatingly slow Indian meal. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The sun set as we crossed
        the channel in a frighteningly fast vessel. Scores of
        hyperactive children screaming in English, French,
        Flemish and German made the short trip seem long, and I
        realized how really and truly exhausted I was. Three
        weeks of torpor had let my cycling legs atrophy, and two
        hilly days had done me in. Once in Dunkerque, we were
        delighted to find cycle paths leading to our suburban
        hotel (could this really be France?), which turned out to
        be a scary pre-fab affair, more trailer than anything
        else. The worst part was carrying our ultra-heavy beasts
        up two flights of stairs and squeezing them into our
        little cell. I slept like a corpse, even though it was on
        a penis pillow.</font></p>
