        Croatia to Hrastnik/Ljubljana, Slovenia, 102 km (f)</b></font><p><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;Zagreb rocks,&quot; Andy kept
        saying. He was overwhelmed by how active the streets of
        this obvious capital were. Neither of us had ever been in
        a city where public spaces were so used. Every bench
        occupied, every square inch of sidewalk stepped upon,
        each tram full and every café alive. I had the sense
        that no one wanted to or could go home so they just
        stayed out all the time.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Unfortunately the streets
        &quot;rocked&quot; with cars on our way out of town. We
        wove through the town looking for a quiet way out and
        found none. Our route to Ljubljana began on a four lane
        agouti highway avoiding ruts and cars while fearing for
        our lives. After about 25km of nail biting while riding
        we made it to the countryside. As we did Andy&#146;s rear
        tire blew out just in front of the only Eastern European
        polo field we&#146;ve come across. Lucky in some small
        way, we had been on the wrong road and only realized that
        we were headed the long way to Ljubljana when we stopped.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The border of Croatia and
        Slovenia was a bit of a worry. The soldier on the
        Croatian side was not able to speak in English so he let
        us pass, but the Slovenian border guard was a little more
        articulate.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">&quot;This border crossing
        is reserved for Croatians and Slovenians only.&quot; Our
        faces dropped as we considered the 40 or 50km of
        backtracking we&#146;d have to do to get to the border he
        suggested in lieu of this one. We looked at one another
        sadly and began to speak as though the border guard
        wasn&#146;t there. &quot;What a shame it comes to this
        after ten thousand kilometers,&quot; I said. &quot;Yeah,
        I was looking forward to seeing Ljubljana,&quot; Andy
        retorted, &quot;guess we&#146;ll have to just backtrack
        and take the train to Rijeka and skip Slovenia
        altogether.&quot; That last comment effected the
        guard&#146;s national pride. &quot;Go ahead,&quot; he
        said reluctantly and handed us our passports. I grabbed
        them and we pedaled as fast as we could before he could
        change his mind.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The afternoon experience
        was wholly different than the morning. A quiet road took
        us through our favorite type of terrain, a valley. The
        only downsides were that it was up the valley and against
        the wind. Speaking of winded, Andy was from the start and
        had trouble finding the energy to push on. He managed,
        the scenery inspiring him. This valley was as lovely as
        the one a few days before in Slovakia, the only
        difference today is that the weather was clear and hot,
        rendering the views spectacular. Getting Slovenian
        agoutis proved to be a challenge; the local flavor of
        cash-o-matics choked on our cards so we exchanged some
        American agoutis.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The drivers here seem
        nearly as bad as the Poles. They go too fast and pass too
        closely. However, most appear to have some idea how big
        their car is unlike their northern counterparts. Our last
        bit of road was to be on the main highway and neither of
        us were up to dodging vehicles for the last K&#146;s so
        we decided to train into Ljubljana. At the train station
        we were swarmed by curious Slovenian kids out in the
        country for a hike with their school. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">A walk about Ljubljana at
        sunset revealed a decidedly different town from the one I
        remembered from my travels. The dilapidated old town
        streets had been treated to new cobbles, spruced-up store
        fronts and yuppified clientele. Riverfront trottoirs had
        lost their bohemian atmosphere and now look like a new
        land at a theme park. Despite the civilized trappings of
        the new Ljubljana, there wasn&#146;t hide nor hair of a
        cash machine that liked any one of our cards, making
        currency the drama du jour. A hotel clerk took us on a
        bank-o-mat tour of Ljubljana in hopes of ferreting out
        Slovene agoutis to no avail. We finally settled on
        exchanging some Croat cash and hit the town. A few beers
        and a light meal later we were back in our room writing
        about our day.</font></p>

        Trogir and back, 91km (a)</b></font><p><font size="2" face="Arial">I had to step through a puddle of elephant
        piss to get to my bike. The sun hadn&#146;t risen yet and
        my brain was still clouded with dreams of sword
        swallowers and bearded ladies. The gray sky became
        lighter as we pedaled aimlessly through the deserted
        hills around </font><a href="glspl.htm" target="contents"><font size="2" face="Arial">Split</font></a><font size="2" face="Arial">.
        It took a long time to find our way to the center of
        town, which turned out to be only a couple hundred flat
        meters from where we had disembarked. Still, I suppose
        taking the ferry was a whole lot easier than riding all
        the way down the Dalmatian coast. From Ljubljana we chose
        the train option once again, both of us realizing that we
        needed a vacation from our vacation. The train took us
        over the mountains and through the rain to the nasty port
        town of Rijeka, where we headed straight to the ferry
        terminal. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">From the bar deck of the
        venerable Marco Polo &#150;an apparent cast-off from the
        Viking Line of Scandinavia&#151;we watched a circus load
        onto the ship. Lots of beat-up trucks with huge words in
        Italian plastered all over them, being directed by
        dwarves and various circus types. When the ship finally
        pulled out, we recognized a tall and glamorous-looking
        Australian woman from our hotel in Zagreb. Iva explained
        that she was born of Croatian parents in Australia, and
        now lives in London. Traveling with her were boyfriend
        Neil and five other Australian expatriates from London.
        All seven of them were young and fresh-faced and excited
        to be on their way to </font><a href="glspl.htm" target="contents"><font size="2" face="Arial">Dubrovnik</font></a><font size="2" face="Arial">, the first stop on a two-week tour. They
        quizzed us extensively on our own trip before the rather
        sullen and contentious Neil launched into a diatribe
        about the virtues of land mines. All the others started
        laying into him, biting at his bait, and I took this as
        my cue to head back down to the cabin to join Fred. I
        wonder how they&#146;re faring now, and feel a special
        empathy for Iva, who has cast herself in the role of
        tourguide/interpreter, which can&#146;t be altogether
        relaxing.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">In any case, relaxation
        was and is our goal in this part of the world. It&#146;s
        very satisfying to know that we have nearly a week to get
        to our next boat in Dubrovnik, only 200 kilometers away. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Split looked and felt
        different from anything we had seen from the instant we
        pedaled off the boat into the murk. It felt balmy even in
        the wee hours, and the sight of palm trees and agave
        delighted me, even though we had cheated to get here. We
        also noticed a distinct change in attitude and pace.
        People seemed warmer and looser, more Mediterranean in
        demeanor. From the only open café terrace in town, we
        watched the town come alive as we listened to the rain
        patter on the umbrellas above our heads. For once we had
        no set program or goal for the day, and the rain made us
        decide to stay in Split. Finding a place to stay proved
        no problem, since women kept coming up to us saying,
        &quot;Sobe?&quot; &#150;which I quickly deduced to
        signify &quot;room&quot; in Croatian. The first two shook
        their heads when we indicated the bikes, but the third
        &#150;a rather unkempt and decrepit old lady with facial
        hair and a limp&#151;said her place was big and right
        around the corner. She led me through a huge gate leading
        into the atmospheric old town &#150;once the palace of
        Roman emperor Diocletian&#151;and up a stairs into her
        dingy abode. The room she proposed was large and built
        right into the palace walls, with a great view of the
        harbor. Before making a hasty decision, I went on a walk
        to check out our options and stumbled upon the Hotel
        Bellevue, where we landed not only a great place to stash
        our bikes (the hotel&#146;s laundry) but also one of the
        larger suites I&#146;ve ever seen. It contains a kitchen,
        a dining room/office, a living room/bedroom plus a second
        bedroom. There&#146;s even a separate room holding the
        bidet. The many windows look out onto the port, the
        islands beyond, and a beautiful old Venetian-style
        square. We could be happy staying here for weeks.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">After settling in, Fred
        and I went exploring the old town, which was more
        happening now that it was past seven a.m. on a Sunday.
        Mass was being performed in the cathedral that was once
        Diocletian&#146;s mausoleum, so we climbed up a rickety
        metal stairway to the top of the campanile. Luckily the
        bells didn&#146;t ring on our way up, and the view from
        the top made me want to call my family and tell them I
        was moving to Split. It&#146;s an incredible place.
        Firstly, there&#146;s the dramatic setting on a turquoise
        bay, framed by rocky mountains and tree-covered islands.
        Then there&#146;s the huge Roman palace that constitutes
        the center of town, an inhabited ruin of ancient columns
        and hanging laundry, surrounded by a warren of little
        streets and plazas left by the Venetians when they ran
        the place. It&#146;s tourist heaven, only without the
        tourists. Most outsiders are still put off by the war, it
        seems.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">After a long walk through
        the underground foundations of the palace and around its
        walls, we ate our lunch on a covered terrace surrounded
        by animated locals in their Sunday best. As we munched
        our spaghetti and salads, the drizzle evolved into a
        downpour, providing a perfect excuse to take a long nap
        before subjecting ourselves to some truly bad Hollywood
        output (&quot;Batman and Robin&quot;, which,
        incidentally, the Croats loved).</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">This morning we thought
        we&#146;d go to a beach listed in the Spartacus Guide,
        thirty-some kilometers up the coast. We took the long way
        out of town, around the huge wooded peninsula that serves
        as Split&#146;s Central Park. A car-free road used
        principally by joggers and roller-bladers snakes along
        the coastline through groves of juniper and cypress,
        providing stunning views of the beaches and turquoise
        water below. The whole effect was shattered, however,
        when this sublime thoroughfare dumped us without warning
        onto the main road out of town. All my theories of the
        laid-back nature of the Dalmatian people evaporated in an
        instant. These people are terrors when they&#146;re
        operating motorized vehicles. A solid line of cars and
        trucks honked at us angrily before speeding by us only a
        hair&#146;s breadth away, making their tires squeak in
        the process whenever possible. Knowing that we&#146;d
        have to come back the same way made it all the more
        nerve-racking. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">A slightly calmer road led
        us through the industrial suburbs and then a string of
        villages along the coast. The stiff wind at our backs
        blew us all the way to Trogir, where we decided to have a
        look around. It&#146;s an old walled town, very
        Venetian-looking with its narrow labyrinthine streets
        punctuated by little squares, and jammed with tourists. I
        wondered if a cruise ship was docked in the port, and
        Fred seemed to read my mind when he suggested a picnic
        lunch on the beach.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Our guide book had listed
        it as a gay nudist beach, but it looked more like a
        watering hole for rhinoceroses. Old Italian and Croat
        hetero couples, their skin hanging off them in folds,
        sprawled along the pebbly beach or floated loglike in the
        water. We chose a spot a little further on, a concrete
        slab poured over some rocks. I stripped the moment we got
        there and stepped into the rough water, figuring a
        pre-lunch paddle would be refreshing. Feeling a sharp
        pain in my foot, I pulled it right back out. I
        didn&#146;t need to look at it to learn that I&#146;d
        stepped on an urchin. After a futile attempt at removing
        some of the spines, I lunched and dozed until the desire
        to swim drove us back to the rhino hole, where we
        splashed around, played backgammon and tried our hardest
        not to look at our neighbors. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The ride back was against
        the wind. This plus our familiarity with the route made
        the trip seem longer than it was. Coming back into town
        was predictably nightmarish, so we treated ourselves to
        another ride along the car-free peninsular, now infested
        with Dalmatian yuppie joggers. The sea glittered in the
        setting sun and I felt like I was on vacation again for
        the first time in what seems like a long while. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">While pedaling hadn&#146;t
        been particularly painful, walking the short block to
        dinner was excruciating. On our way back we stopped in a
        market to get some white vinegar. Fred says he remembers
        it from a first aid class he took in sixth grade as the
        remedy for urchin spines. Hopefully he remembers
        correctly; otherwise I&#146;d feel pretty stupid soaking
        my foot in a bag full of vinegar here, my toes smelling
        like a salad.</font></p>

        Split. The evening before we left he went to a
        &quot;pediker&quot; (foot specialist) to have his pickled
        foot treated. Biting on a towel he sat back while the
        twenty-or-so black needles were removed. On our last
        night a nearly total eclipse of the full moon cast an
        eerie red glow upon the old city. Most of the locals
        didn&#146;t even notice because they were fascinated by
        the World Cup Finals. Before we left we found from a
        local homo that there was no gay life as we know it in
        Croatia. &quot;There could be no gay bar in
        Croatia,&quot; said the Dalmatian. Not surprising when
        you consider that the Croats can&#146;t even tolerate
        their brethren who are ethnically identical but have a
        different religion. It does seem odd when you consider
        that the average Croatian seems pretty laid-back. On our
        last day at breakfast we joked about how funny it would
        be to have sex with a local just to be able to tell
        everyone we&#146;d &quot;done it with a Dalmatian&quot;
        and watch their subsequent facial expression.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Remarkably Andy navigated
        us out of town on an extra quiet route. The only
        downsides were that we had to walk the bikes a bit on a
        footpath and the formidable ascent we had to make to
        finally rejoin the main road. On the main road we decided
        we&#146;d come upon the absolute worst drivers of the
        trip. Driving too close to us, speeding by all coupled
        with a honk just as they are about to pass win them the
        title.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">We opted to suffer the
        high road along the coast to escape the drivers after a
        beachside lunch/swim/nap triathlon by the mesmerizingly
        blue and clear Adriatic. Even on the high road the few
        drivers there were managed to get close to us on the
        nearly vacant road. They still honked as though we
        couldn&#146;t hear their cars straining to make the
        grade. Cypress tree smells filled the air. Frequently the
        fresh tree smells were eclipsed by the smell of forest
        fires present and past. From high above the water we
        watched a tanker plane fight a fire. It made great
        circles in the air and through the water. First dipping
        into the sea to pick up its cargo and then dumping it on
        the hillside.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Perplexed by the
        discrepancies between our map, roadsigns and terrain, we
        sought counsel from a dude and his family building a new
        residence. Antonio took a break from his labors to invite
        us for a beverage. A concentrated juice made from sugar
        and flowers was brought out with some cold water and
        served. Andy nearly drank the undiluted concentrate but
        was saved by Antonio. An electronic engineer by trade,
        Antonio claimed that the fires were started by bad power
        lines. We viewed his opinion circumspectly having seen
        more unextinguished cigarettes thrown from cars than we
        care to mention. Adriatic Croats have no problem throwing
        butts or anything else along the road. I haven&#146;t
        seen some much debris on the shoulder since the southern
        United States. Everything went over the side from ice
        cream wrappers to old cars. We started counting discarded
        washing machines at some point to pass the time.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Even with the trash I was
        completely floored by the physical beauty of this region.
        I remember thinking to myself that this place is probably
        more beautiful than the coast of California. Certainly it
        is less spoiled by the population&#146;s crimes against
        it. We paused to ogle the blue water and staggering views
        after a white knuckle descent to the main highway. We had
        a new BikeBrats snack consisting of ½ liter of beer and
        four scoops of ice cream. The beer made for a hazy entry
        into Makarska. By the bay in Makarska we stopped at the
        tourist office where a room in a private house was
        arranged. The clerk&#146;s prepubescent daughter was
        assigned the task of leading us to our accommodation and
        did so very reluctantly. We pushed our bikes after her up
        the steepest hills of the day, leaving us out of breath
        and dripping with sweat when we reached Maria&#146;s
        house.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">There we were welcomed by
        her warm smile and a glass of deadly resin-impregnated
        white wine that left both of us woozy. We somehow
        staggered into town for dinner where I treated myself to
        the biggest meatiest meal I could find &#150; the Gypsy
        Brochette. Sausage, lamb, veal and bacon came drowned in
        roasted onions, tomatoes and potatoes. Somehow we made it
        back up to our room and rolled into bed, drowned in the
        light of the moon.</font></p>

        Makarska, Croatia to Medugorje, Bosnia-Herzegovina, 76km
        (a)</b></font><p><font size="2" face="Arial">Our hostess
        Maria told us that the road to </font><a href="glmed.htm" target="contents"><font size="2" face="Arial">Medjugorje</font></a><font size="2" face="Arial"> would be easy and flat, but by nine this
        morning we were 600 meters up the side of a massive rock,
        sweat dripping off our bodies. I guess spending your
        whole life on a steep hill can makes &quot;flat&quot; a
        relative concept. The view of the azure sea directly
        below us was exhilarating, and would have been more so
        had we had any food in our bellies. Breakfast was not
        part of the package offered by Maria, though I did manage
        to beg some coffee out of her. We drank it while she
        slurped down yogurt and cereal. Fred, unable to function
        before his morning meal, looked at her with frank envy.
        Not feeling up to braving the hill down into town, we
        figured we&#146;d stop at the first place along the way
        &#150;a near fatal mistake.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">When we finally rolled
        into Ivan&#146;s café and goatisserie in the middle of
        nowhere, high up in the mountains which divide Croatia
        and Bosnia, we were ready to kill for food. The innkeeper
        made us sandwiches, which we scarfed down as we watched a
        man pull a skewered goat our of his car and hand it to
        Ivan to put in on the spit of his open-air oven. The
        shiny mass of red tendons and eyeballs looked tasty
        enough to eat raw.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">A little further on we
        stocked up on more food. It was the last town before the
        Bosnian border and Fred was afraid we wouldn&#146;t find
        anything to eat in the war-torn country we were about to
        enter. His hoarding instinct kicked in, and soon we were
        weighted down with enough fruit, water, and chocolate to
        be mistaken for an envoy of the Red Cross.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The operations at the
        Bosnian border are an exercise in cynicism, since Croats
        run the show. A guy with a gun and a uniform briefly
        looks at your passport and lets you by. There is no
        Bosnian side to the border, no &quot;Welcome to
        Bosnia&quot; sign, no real indication that you&#146;ve
        left Croatia &#150;which is of course precisely how the
        land-hungry Croats want it. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Nevertheless, we did
        notice some differences. Firstly we felt an increased
        presence of IFOR and SFOR (which stupidly stands for
        &quot;Stabilization FORce&quot;, I later learned from an
        American who worked for them). At one point I nearly fell
        off my bike from the shock of seeing a trio of tanks
        cruise down the road towards us. Like all the other
        traffic, the tanks were traveling at far too high a speed
        to be considered safe. Diesel-driven Mercedes skimmed our
        panniers, laying into their horns as they passed us.
        Buses hurtled towards Mostar and cement trucks announced
        Armageddon. Bosnians easily surpass their Croat brethren
        in the bad driving category. They made the last few
        kilometers into Medugorje interminable. I decided that
        making it there in one piece would qualify as a miracle.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The possibility of a
        miracle is, after all, the reason pilgrims flock to
        Medugorje, a little village not far from Mostar. I had
        heard about the place from Peter in Copenhagen, who
        recently made a documentary on Medugorje for Danish
        television. In 1981 six local youngsters reported having
        visions of the Blessed Virgin Mary (or </font><a href="glmed.htm" target="contents"><font size="2" face="Arial">BVM</font></a><font size="2" face="Arial"> &#150;an acronym we got from the
        Zagreb Historical Museum) on a daily or near-daily basis,
        usually just before dinnertime. Some of these
        &quot;visionaries&quot; hold private audiences (for a
        fee, of course) or lead groups of pilgrims up to a hill
        outside of town where the first visions occurred. Neither
        of these activities figured into our plans, however. I
        thought we&#146;d have lunch, check out the church and
        the scene in general, and then get the hell out and head
        50 kilometers south to Neum, the only town on the
        minuscule Bosnian coast. It was blisteringly hot and I
        longed for another swim. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Fred convinced me to
        change my mind on the day&#146;s itinerary. He said he
        was too tired to pedal and thought Medugorje might be
        worth spending a night. Initially reluctant to spend so
        much as a penny in such a place, I finally capitulated.
        We ate in a place called Kathy&#146;s Katholic Kitchen or
        some such nonsense, run by an Irish girl (guess what her
        name is) and patronized chiefly by her Mary-mad
        compatriots. I quizzed her about the visionaries and she
        told me that the BVM normally appears to them at their
        homes at a predetermined moment, during which a silent
        vigil is observed by mass-goers in the church. It sounded
        pretty bogus to me, but I withheld the opinion,
        preferring not to have my sandwich poisoned. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">We checked into the Pax
        Hotel, an ugly concrete structure identical to every
        other building in this boomtown of religious tourism.
        Gracing the walls were works of uninspired Katholic
        Kitsch; the receptionist quoted a rate in German marks.
        As far as we could tell, all the other guests were
        French, Italian and &#133;American. They all seemed to be
        devout elderly folks on package tours, and I wonder if
        anyone warned them that they had booked a trip to Bosnia.
        I suppose miracles know no boundaries.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">A sunset walk gave us an
        idea of the scale of the tourist industry in once-tiny
        Medugorje. Haphazard construction spread out in every
        direction, presumably for more hotels, more restaurants,
        more souvenir shops. Shiny new taxis and busloads of
        pilgrims clogged the narrow lane that comprises the
        town&#146;s only real thoroughfare. Behind the new church
        (we never did find the old one, nor the original village
        for that matter) some sort of prayer meeting was underway
        under a canopied structure reminiscent of a big top, and
        the countless rows of empty benches on the perimeter of
        this showed us that Medugorje is equipped to handle even
        more mass-going masses. On another side of the church
        priests loitered around under signs indicating their
        linguistic capabilities, waiting to take confession or to
        perform layings on of hands upon invalids. Most of the
        Americans we came across were buried in the gift shops,
        pricing useless objects sporting images of the BVM and
        wondering aloud which rosary would be appropriate for
        cousin Eileen back in Baltimore. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">As the bells began to
        toll, more and more pilgrims flocked towards the church.
        The time had apparently come for the special evening
        mass-plus-silent-visionary-vigil. We took this as our cue
        to position ourselves in a deserted pizzeria directly
        across from the church. Munching hungrily and noting the
        rapid onset of dusk, I asked myself if the BVM observes
        daylight savings time in her apparitions. Does she always
        show up at precisely the same time of day? Our waiter and
        his colleagues appeared distinctly unimpressed by the
        miraculous moment, and I asked him if he was a believer.
        He pretended not to understand.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">I asked the same question
        of the trendy-looking girl who sold us one of the
        cheesier postcard albums I&#146;ve ever seen. It took a
        while for my message to get through, but she nodded her
        head: &quot;Of course I believe.&quot; We got the same
        response from the girl who sold Fred a BVM tee shirt. We
        tried to bargain her down, asking for a
        nonbeliever&#146;s discount, which caused her to feign
        shock and jokingly ask for double the price. I guess
        it&#146;s never a good idea to bite the hand that feeds
        you. While the BVM apparitions remain open to skepticism
        (not even the Vatican has authenticated them yet), the
        economic miracle in Medugorje is indisputable. </font></p>

        Medugorje, Bosnia-Herzegovina to Dubrovnik, Croatia, 136
        km (f)</b></font><p><font size="2" face="Arial">I
        didn&#146;t dream about the BVM this night; instead I had
        a strange one that involved a tiger chasing Andy and me
        on our bikes. Somehow I managed to have a great
        night&#146;s sleep despite the very loud and late arrival
        of 34 American Catholics from Indianapolis. We were a
        little disappointed that none of them were with us at
        breakfast at the crack of dawn. Andy had been especially
        keen on quizzing them on the subject of their trip to
        Bosnia. We ran into a couple as we checked out of the
        Hotel and loaded the bikes. Harold and his wife wanted to
        &quot;check things out.&quot; Harold indicated that he
        was a skeptic so I quizzed him to clarify his comment.
        Less than diplomatically I queried, &quot;So you think
        that all of this is a hoax?&quot; I watched Andy cringe
        across the parking lot, he only heard that question and
        thought I began the conversation that way. Harold
        answered, &quot;no, I mean that it just seems that you
        shouldn&#146;t have to cross the oceans to find such a
        thing, perhaps you should look in your own
        backyard&#133;.&quot; </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">We made an early start,
        exiting the splendor of Medugorje by eight. Even at this
        hour the sun was already hot. Within a few kilometers we
        passed the SFOR (the international peacekeeping force)
        outpost. I stopped to take a photo of the enclave, but
        was prohibited from doing so. The Spanish sentry
        didn&#146;t speak English but did speak &quot;no&quot;
        and had the hardware to enforce his wishes. Even without
        a photo it is pretty easy to imagine: think of a million
        miles of razor wire, hundreds of dudes with big guns and
        more tanks and armored personnel carriers than you can
        wave a rosary at. The encampment was very intimidating,
        even for the Bosnian drivers. They seemed to take a break
        from their normal irresponsible driving to slow down and
        drive carefully in front of the place. (I learned why
        everyone seemed especially nervous on this day only after
        reaching </font><a href="glspl.htm" target="contents"><font size="2" face="Arial">Dubrovnik</font></a><font size="2" face="Arial">. A bomb went off in front of the Croatian
        controlled police station in Mostar the night before,
        only 15 kilometers from where we were, injuring over 50
        people.)</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Riding through a broad and
        wide river valley we passed back into Croatia thanking
        the BVM that some nutty Bosnian driver didn&#146;t run us
        over. Trying to find the small road to Dubrovnik we
        sought council from a pump jockey at a gas station.
        Though the jack-o-lantern toothed dude was convinced we
        should take the busy highway, Andy got him to relent and
        tell us how to find the small road. A good thing too.
        Just a few kilometers down the pike a roadworks project
        blocked passage for cars and we had the road to ourselves
        until lunch. We even had our very own border crossing
        where three friendly (not) Croats sent us back into
        Bosnia.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">A steep ascent greeted us
        there. We re-climbed the coastal mountains entering back
        into Dalmatia. For the next several kilometers we climbed
        a grade that ranged from 9 to12%. Tough, but it afforded
        us a great perspective of where we&#146;d been earlier
        this day.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Reaching the top we
        revisited the familiar coastal landscape. A quick lunch
        of risotto and salad and we were on our way. Andy was
        decidedly energy free; the climb &quot;did him in&quot;
        he admitted later.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Our coastal path treated
        us to yet another afternoon of sweeping views of the
        ocean and steep hillsides along the shore. Ancient
        abandoned terraced plots ran patchwork down the inclines
        where olive and cypress trees grew untended. We kept
        noticing blemishes on the road that looked distinctly
        ballistic in nature. The holes looked hastily patched and
        I wrote them off to falling rocks or geologic
        instability, not willing to succumb to the paranoid
        notion that they were caused by the war. We reached a
        little village that looked perfect from a distance.
        Charming quiet streets, stately church tower, sunny
        swimming harbor, waterside residences and winding streets
        made it look like an archetypal seaside European town.
        The illusion of perfection diminished as we got closer.
        We began to notice that all was not right in </font><a href="glwar.htm" target="contents"><font size="2" face="Arial">Slano</font></a><font size="2" face="Arial">. Sure there were kids still
        playing in the water of the harbor, but the only
        operating business was a café which was situated in the
        only building that looked whole. Every other structure
        had some mortar inflicted scar or more severe damage.
        Roofs were blown off, residences seared by fire, tilted
        by ballistic concussion or vaporized by a direct hit.
        Here many of the &quot;blemishes&quot; on the road were
        not patched and looked exactly as the ones on the main
        highway had.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">After Slano we rode
        quietly, the enormity of the war tragedy sinking in as we
        pedaled towards Dubrovnik. We stopped for a drink along
        the way and somehow settled on having a beer in a little
        town called Orsan. The cafe there had tables on the water
        from which you could dive into the crystal clear
        Adriatic. Andy and the other patrons took advantage of
        that facility. Our waitress treated us to some
        &quot;helpful&quot; advice on our route to Dubrovnik.
        &quot;It is flat and only 16 kilometers,&quot; she said
        convincingly. We were cursing her as we made the 50 meter
        ascent out of Orsan. It may have been 16 kilometers
        &quot;as the crow flies&quot;, or if they had finished
        the bridge that was to span the huge inlet just north
        Dubrovnik. Instead we had to travel inland for 4
        kilometers and then back to the coast again making the
        remainder of the trip close to 30km. The distance
        wasn&#146;t as bothersome as the nasty hills within
        Dubrovnik that finally did Andy in.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">After Bosnia and two very
        tough riding days I was ready to have a relaxing and
        comfortable day or two in Dubrovnik. We found a
        once-glamorous commie hotel called the Argentina could
        provide a suitable venue for our rest. The only room
        remaining with a sea view was the &quot;politburo
        suite&quot;. It consisted of two seventies decorated
        rooms with ceilings which seemed higher than the
        mountains around the city. The reception room was painted
        puke green and had two tasteful white leather couches and
        four white leather bucket seats around a glass table. The
        only thing missing to make the 70&#146;s imagery complete
        was Bee Gees and Abba muzak. The bedroom was more
        tastefully furnished, but the decorated had his (or her)
        revenge by painting this room orange. Looking past the
        flawed interior, our windows and balcony were portals to
        the Adriatic which we had come to know and love.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">After rolling our bikes
        into our glamorous accommodation and cleaning up we
        headed for town. From a distance the fortifications of
        Dubrovnik were more impressive than I&#146;d ever
        imagined. There was no evidence of the shelling that
        pounded the town just a few years before. As we entered
        the walls I felt the streets seemed just a little too
        quiet, almost eerie. Suddenly we rounded a corner and the
        city&#146;s nightlife unfolded for us. The gleaming
        foot-traffic polished marble walkway of Dubrovnik&#146;s
        primary promenade lay before us. It was packed with
        tourists and locals walking, gabbing, drinking and
        eating. Their voices bounced off the buildings. For us
        the social vortex was a little too much to handle. A bite
        and walk is all we could muster after our tough ride.
        Exploring Dubrovnik&#146;s fortifications and streets
        would be left for the next day.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The next morning I found
        that our daylight view from the &quot;green&quot;
        room&#146;s balcony was even more spectacular than the
        evening view. The aquamarine shoreline framed the old
        harbor and city. We walked to town, mounted the wall and
        circumnavigated the city getting an aerial tour of the
        old town. Only then did the evidences of reconstruction
        past and present make themselves known. The first
        suspicious &quot;tell&quot; was that nearly all of the
        city&#146;s roofs had been recently re-tiled. Later we
        came upon a map that detailed all of the bombardment
        damage. I was shocked to see that almost every block of
        the town had substantial damage. It was hard to imagine
        after having seen how pristine the city is now. Angry
        thoughts crept into my mind when I pondered what type of
        conflict could inspire the bombing of a place like
        Dubrovnik.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The remainder of the day
        was reserved for a BikeBrats pentathlon, bathing (sea and
        sun), backgammon, imbibing and reading. It was a most
        invigorating event. Andy was the victor in the swimming
        and backgammon events, the others too close to call.</font></p>
