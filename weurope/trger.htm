        Holland to Oldenburg/Hamburg, Germany, 115km</b></font><p><font size="2" face="Arial">While planning this trip, tracing
        my finger along the route I wanted to follow, I was
        always irritated by the chunk of Germany dividing Holland
        from Denmark. What was a country like Germany doing
        separating these two supremely civilized nations?
        Eventually, I accepted that there was no getting around
        it, and that we&#146;d have to deal with it when we got
        there.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Of course I never
        anticipated pedaling through the remnant of the Third
        Reich on my own, so it was with special sense of dread
        that I woke up this morning in my tent, at five-thirty
        a.m. I lay in my knotted sleeping bag for a while,
        listening to the ducks splash noisily in the lake and
        waiting for human sounds to signal that it was okay to
        get up and move around. None came, though, so I started
        cleaning my chain at around seven, trying to be as silent
        as possible. There was still no one stirring as I packed
        my bags, folded up my tent, and headed out of town under
        the menacing sky. The Dutch apparently like to sleep
        late.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Bourtanges was only twenty
        kilometers away, but it felt a lot longer without any
        coffee in my belly, fighting a headwind and cursing the
        drizzle. Still, I was struck again by how beautiful
        Holland is, and what a great achievement that is for such
        a flat place: why couldn&#146;t they have done this with
        Illinois? As I mused upon this question, a familiar smell
        enveloped me. In my pre-caffeinated state it took me a
        while to realize that I was surrounded by fields of
        marijuana (or at least hemp) plants. I was half-tempted
        to harvest one for myself, but wasn&#146;t so sure that
        the Germans would take kindly to my arriving in their
        Fatherland with a big pot plant bungeed to my rear rack.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">My bike was making a funny
        sound so I stopped in the first town &#150;called
        Sellingen&#151;where a guy in wooden shoes sold me a
        spoke wrench. Another similarly shod dude sold me a
        banana. Wooden shoes were everywhere. It soon became
        apparent that Sellingen is a wooden shoe center (perhaps
        because of its proximity to the German border: last
        chance for tourists to buy a pair), with homemade models
        on display in front of many of the village houses. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">I got a little lost on the
        way to Bourtanges, another star-shaped fortress of a town
        --actually a lot more fortress than town. No fewer than
        three concentric walls, separated by moats. I&#146;ve
        never seen such a well-defended place. As I rode over the
        second drawbridge into the village, I wondered what there
        ever was to defend here. The whole village occupied less
        than a hectare, and consisted of a central square acting
        as a hub for the six or eight street-spokes, each only
        one block long, that lead to the innermost set of walls.
        I spent the last of my guilders here on a cup of coffee
        and a miserable excuse for a sandwich: a slice of
        velveeta-esque cheese on a Wonder hamburger bun. In my
        experience, Dutch cuisine ranks among the world&#146;s
        worst. But of course I haven&#146;t been to Lithuania
        yet&#133; Munching on my meager repast and staring off
        into the drizzle, I realized with irony that I was going
        to miss Holland a lot.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">I crossed the German
        border on a deserted road, and one of the first things I
        saw was a sign indicating the speed limit for tanks
        &#150;rather disquieting right at the Dutch border, I
        thought. I was pleased to see, however, that there was a
        bike path. It wasn&#146;t nearly as well-maintained as
        the ones in Holland, though, and certainly not as used.
        It seems like everyone here has traded in his or her
        three-speed for a shiny new Mercedes. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Outside of the
        character-free town of Dorpen, I got a little lost again
        before hooking up with the Kustenkanal, which I followed
        for 70 mind-numbingly dull kilometers. The road was
        indicated as scenic on my Michelin map. I guess those
        wacky tire makers in Clermont-Ferrand find truck traffic
        scenic. At least there was a bike path&#151;albeit a very
        bumpy one-- affording occasional glimpses of the
        industrial-looking canal through the underbrush. For
        many, many miles, I didn&#146;t pass through a single
        village or see a single fellow cyclist. Pedaling against
        the wind in such flat and dull surroundings quickly took
        on a purgatorial aspect, so I leapt at the first chance
        to take an alternate route, a smaller road on the other
        side of the canal. This road was much prettier, like a
        tunnel through a canopy of trees, and passed through
        ersatz villages with strange names, like Harben I and
        Jeddeloh II. &quot;What kind of straight person named
        these places?&quot; I wondered, &quot;A disgruntled
        Deutches Telekom employee?&quot; My question was soon
        answered by a rock which commemorated Harben I&#146;s 50<sup>th</sup>
        anniversary, in 1985. &#150;Hitler! Of course! </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">From here on, I was
        reminded as I always am in Germany of the &quot;Fawlty
        Towers&quot; episode where John Cleese instructs his
        hotel employees how to welcome German guests.
        &quot;Whatever you do, don&#146;t mention the War,&quot;
        he tells them, only to begin goose-stepping himself once
        the Germans arrive. It&#146;s impossible not to think of
        the war, since evidence of it is everywhere here: towns
        which were obviously flattened and hastily rebuilt; the
        countryside dotted with bunkers; a near total absence of
        men over sixty. Whenever I see an older person in the
        street in this strange country &#150;almost invariably a
        woman&#151;I can&#146;t help but think that she voted for
        Hitler as her leader, her fuhrer. . I guess I&#146;ve
        seen too many war movies filled with anti-Nazi
        propaganda. As hard as I try, I can&#146;t get thoughts
        of the war out of my mind in my dealings with Germans,
        which makes it impossible for me to relax or even feel at
        ease here.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">I had ridden well over a
        hundred kilometers by the time I reached Oldenburg, and
        it seemed a pleasant enough place to spend the night,
        full of cyclists and sidewalk cafes. But as I&#146;m
        expected in Copenhagen on Saturday night, I hopped on a
        train to Hamburg after a late lunch (at 4:30) of
        bratwurst and beer. Unfortunately, I had to change trains
        (and platforms) in Bremen, meaning schlepping my
        fully-loaded monster bike up and down stairs. The first
        train looked and felt like a rolling hospital waiting
        room. A young, zaftig conductor mercifully helped me get
        my bike into the luggage compartment and sold me a
        ticket. It wasn&#146;t until he turned around to serve
        the next passenger that I noticed the shape of a bat
        shaved into his hair. I conversed briefly with a young,
        cute Pakistani on his way to Hamburg for business. I told
        him we might be pedaling through his country next year,
        and he responded, &quot;Yes, but why a bicycle?&quot; He
        gave me his e-mail address and stared at me with frank
        and discomfiting desire. When it was time to get off the
        train, he couldn&#146;t help me with my bike, since all
        his energy was devoted to a feeble attempt at concealing
        his&#133;uh&#133; tumescence. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The train to Hamburg was
        miles long and of course I had to rush all the way to the
        other end of it for the luggage car. Again, the staff
        were helpful and friendly and I wondered if I should be
        visiting Germany by train rather than by bike. It was hot
        and I was sweating from all the effort, so I sought out a
        compartment with an open window. When I found one it
        contained two friendly German businessmen. Jack lives in
        Izmir, Turkey, and owns a dried fruit operation, while
        his agent, Wolfgang, lives in Hamburg. In order to
        converse with me, Jack closed the window, causing me
        nearly to suffocate. I gave praise to Jesus that it was a
        fast train; in no time at all, we were in Hamburg, where
        Wolfgang&#146;s beautiful 20-something Ameriphilic son
        met us at the platform. He expressed his regret at not
        having the time to show me around the city, and I
        expressed it right back. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">I was beat from all the
        heat and all the traveling, and made the mistake of
        choosing a hotel blindly from the Spartacus Guide.
        &quot;Harald&#146;s Hotel and Bar&quot; leapt out at me
        from the page With such an excellent name, how could I go
        wrong? Indeed, after a short pedal across the great
        blandness of central Hamburg, I found myself in a
        comfortable room overlooking a garden and was assisted
        with my luggage by an adorable creature called Adam. My
        impression was not to last, however. After a necessary
        shower and change, I went down to the bar for a beer. The
        place was full of amazingly cute boys, whom I soon
        learned to be whores. Many of them flirted with me,
        causing in me a <i>crise de viellesse. </i>Could I
        possibly look old enough to be a potential client? I
        quickly downed my beer and went outside to have a walk
        around. Reeperbahn, I soon learned, is a huge
        German-style (read: antiseptic) red light district. All
        up and down the street, I was assaulted by the
        come-on&#146;s of touts in front of &quot;cabaret&quot;
        shows and whores (of the female variety, that is) of all
        shapes and sizes. One block was so full of working girls
        that walking down it was like running the Gauntlet. I
        soon learned to stay on the other side of the street. All
        the sordid tat spilled into the side streets of the
        Reeperbahn as well. One street called &quot;Grosse
        Freiheit Strasse&quot; &#150;which I think means
        something like &quot;big freedom
        street&quot;&#151;resembled uncannily the infamous
        Patpong in Bangkok. The same neon, the same touts, the
        same swillers of beer. I peeked into a number of bars but
        didn&#146;t dare go into any of them. Inside were drunken
        sailors, elderly whores and derelicts of every sort.
        After gobbling down a nasty dinner, I beat a hasty
        retreat to my room. To me, Hamburg looked like a giant
        Fassbinder film come to life, and I didn&#146;t feel
        quite equipped to deal with it yet.</font></p>

        <td><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>11 July,
        Hamburg/Neumunster to Grossenbrode, 126km</b></font><p><font size="2" face="Arial">When I was little I found it
        humorous that there existed somewhere a whole city full
        of people who called themselves hamburgers. And I suppose
        I still do (the &quot;Gute Fahrt&quot; signs one sees on
        the way out of villages also remain a source of puerile
        amusement for me). Yesterday I spent a whole day among
        the Hamburgers, a day which marked for me the arrival of
        summer. It was warm and gloriously sunny for the first
        time in what felt like months. The road beckoned, but I
        spent the day trapped and baking in travel agencies and
        telephone booths, trying to arrange travel from
        Copenhagen to Milwaukee for my grandmother&#146;s
        memorial service next week. I walked from place to place
        in order to make sense of this immense town. It felt
        efficient and flavorless (two adjectives which have
        always summed up the whole of Germany for me; for many
        years I have maintained that Germany is &quot;the Ohio of
        Europe&quot;, and I remain steadfast). There were only a
        few old buildings, hemmed in by busy roadways and
        office/apartment blocks designs by graduates of the
        Legoland school of architecture. Looking down almost any
        street, it loomed there in the distance: the
        radiotelekommunication-tower-mit-der-revolvingrestaurantamdertopp.
        Every large German town seems to have at least one. The
        center was full of expensive shops and people carrying
        shopping bags, the overall impression being that of
        mercantilism gone awry (I suppose that the Reeperbahn is
        just another side to this phenomenon). On the advice of
        several different people, I also took a stroll along the
        lake in the center of town, which is precisely inverse to
        Ter Apel&#146;s lake back in Holland. It has an organic
        shape to it on the map, but is in reality almost
        perfectly square, in order to fit into das
        HamburgerMasterPlann. I also took a look at the
        much-touted harborside, which is almost monumentally
        ugly. It goes on forever and consists of a monotonous
        series of floating docks that are really just two-level
        barges. Walking along them, with the docks listing one
        way and the boats the other, I got a hint of what it
        feels like to be seasick for the first time in my life.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">In the evening I went out
        once again in search of a decent watering hole, figuring
        that a city as enormous as Hamburg must have at least
        one. When I asked the boys in my hotel&#146;s bar where
        one could find a bar that didn&#146;t also act as a
        supermarket, I was met with blank stares. I actually
        ended up finding two, though neither could hold a candle
        to the queer bars of, say, El Paso. At a place called
        Rudy&#146;s I spoke &#150;or rather listened&#151;at
        length to a 67-year old Swiss opera singer named Franz.
        He was verbose yet fascinating, full of stories of an
        on-and-off boyfriend of yore from Laredo, Texas, a
        fabulous green dressing gown from Mexico City that made
        its debut on an Atlantic crossing aboard the France, and
        a libidnous stage director in Aix-en-Provence. His
        delivery was theatrical to a fault, and as engaging as
        his tales were, I felt a bit uncomfortable being cast in
        the role of the audience. Later, I went to a potentially
        excellent dive called &quot;Wunderbar&quot;, where my
        attention was attracted to an intriguing-looking girl
        sporting a no-nonsense blond hairdo and pointy
        horn-rimmed glasses. She was the only girl in the place
        and obviously alone,. To strike up a conversation, I used
        the wrong approach, asking her what such a gorgeous
        creature was doing in such a dump. She apparently
        didn&#146;t catch my intended ironic tone, and answered
        in a very serious monotone: &quot;Id&#146;s a homosegsual
        bar and I am homosegsual.&quot; Uta &#150;as I learned
        she was called-- went on to tell me how she had just
        moved to Hamburg from Stuttgart for her job and how she
        felt a bit lonely in her new surroundings. We compared
        extensive notes on our common state of solitude, and we
        seemed to be talking on precisely the same wavelength.
        But maybe it was just the beer.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">I didn&#146;t leave
        Hamburg today until past one this afternoon. The
        amazingly patient Fraulein Schmidt, from one of the
        travel agencies I had been dealing with, came through
        with a ticket that didn&#146;t cost the equivalent of
        Zambia&#146;s GNP. Only problem was that her computers
        were down all morning. And to further complicate things
        (my theory is that Germans like things to be
        complicated), I had to pay for it in cash, which meant a
        wild goose chase through the banks of Hamburg attired in
        already sweaty cycling gear. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">I took train to get out of
        town, all the way to the little town of Neumunster.
        Riding in the baggage car with me was a Dutch boy named
        Nick, who was also riding his bike from Holland to
        Denmark. It was his first extensive bicycle trip and he
        was cheating too, wanting to get to the relative
        civilization and coziness of Denmark a.s.a.p. He
        complained unabashedly about the state of the German bike
        paths, the high costs of everything, and the
        unfriendliness of the people. He changed trains in
        Neumunster to get closer to the border, but if his ride
        this afternoon was anything like mine, he may very well
        have changed his mind about Germany, since the riding was
        nothing short of sublime.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">I rode through a landscape
        of rolling hills carpeted with waving fields of wheat and
        corn, liberally sprinkeld with rippling blue lakes and
        lush forests. Had the train somehow transported me to
        Wisconsin? I caught myself longing to linger in this
        enchanted area for a few extra days and fantasized about
        doing it with Fred. Every now a Gunther or a Greta would
        come screaming around a corner in a BMW, disrupting the
        splendor of it all, but most of the day was perfect
        cycling bliss. The road between the tiny village of
        Langenhangen and Oldenburg Im Holstein (which explained
        the presence of so many black and white cows) was
        particularly splendiforous. It was the golden time of
        day, where the light makes everything look beautiful, and
        the narrow road plunged through meadows and glades
        towards the glistening sea in the distance. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Further on, I endured a
        minor catastrophe. I had meant to get as close as
        possible to the ferry for Denmark, which leaves from
        Puttgarden on the island of Fehmarn, but the road running
        alongside the highway came to an abrupt end under the
        bridge. There was a long and steep staircase, halfway up
        which I pushed my bike, using all the strength I had.
        When I investigated the steeper and narrower part
        remaining, I realized it meant crossing over train tracks
        and two sets of guardrails. I went back to join my bike
        feeling helpless, and the thundering noise of a train
        passing overhead made it clear that I&#146;d have to turn
        back. This meant unloading my bike completely and making
        several trips up and down. Exhausted and famished, I
        wanted to cry. I had intended to check into a youth
        hostel marked on my map on the other side of the bridge,
        thus marking another bikebrats first. But it was getting
        dark and I had to backtrack all the way to Grossenbrode;
        I&#146;d have to spend the night there. I ran into a
        vanfull of Chinese people frantically looking for the
        campground, and figured I followed them. But the place
        was a zoo, swarming with people. It looked like
        Woodstock. After employing my rusty Chinese to help them
        get their site lined up, I filled out the paperwork for a
        site of my own before having a princess attack. There was
        going to be a party at the nearby beach, the campground
        manager told me, and I could get food there. I imagined
        myself staying up late again, sleeping on the hard
        ground, being awakened by loud and drunken German
        partygoers and walking two hundred meters every time I
        needed to pee. Crumpling up the form I had just filled
        out, I asked the manager where I could find the nearest
        hotel. After all the trials I had been through today and
        functioning on piteously little sleep, I figured the
        least I deserved was a decent night&#146;s sleep.</font></p>
