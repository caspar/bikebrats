        to Camp Wood, 81 miles</b></font><p><font size="2" face="Arial">Yesterday&#146;s plan to wait out the bad
        weather and spend an extra day in Del Rio kind of
        backfired on us. Still, we both felt we needed the lazy
        day of movie-watching, napping and saunaing before
        hitting the road again. The highlight of our extended
        stay in what is certainly not Texas&#146; most charming
        bordertown was on Monday night, when we went to Mexico
        for dinner to celebrate our updated Web site. Dinner was
        good and the margaritas were even better at an old
        touristy place called Crosby&#146;s; more entertaining,
        though, was coming back over the border on foot. The
        bridge over the Rio Grande was long, dark, and full of
        dubious-looking characters. Immigration officer Paul
        explained that they were waiting for a chance to cut a
        hole in the fence, and that fence patching was a big part
        of a border patrolman&#146;s job. He delightedly told us
        some of his favorite I&amp;NS stories, like the American
        guy they caught coming in with a bottle of diet pills up
        his butt. &quot;If I were gonna put something up my butt,
        it would at least be crack or something,&quot; Paul
        stated with surprising humor and nonchalance. We gave him
        our Web address and I hope he looks us up.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">This morning we woke up
        and it looked even nastier outside than yesterday, and
        since Del Rio was beginning to feel a little like the
        movie &quot;Groundhogs Day&quot;, we decided to ride
        anyway. It was our slowest and wettest to date, due to a
        fierce headwind blowing rain into our faces all day. The
        first thirty-two miles to Bracketville were especially
        unpleasant. All the other patrons at the Crazy Chicken
        Café/Gas Station/Convenience Store looked at us in
        horror as we entered, dripping all over the floor and
        encrusted in road filth. The woman working the register
        balked when we told her where we were headed. After
        trying to dissuade us from taking the possibly flooded
        back roads to Camp Wood, she paused to stare at us,
        explaining, &quot;I&#146;m tryin&#146; to get a good look
        at you, in case you get swept away by a flash
        flood.&quot; A tattooed off-duty chief deputy assured us
        that he hadn&#146;t heard of any problems on the road,
        but with the rain still falling, it felt like an
        adventure.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Our surroundings changed
        dramatically as we left Bracketville and entered the
        famous Texas Hill Country. It was as if we crossed some
        invisible line that separates the West from the South.
        Dust and rocks and mesquite gave way to rolling green
        meadows carpeted with wildflowers and groves of oak and
        elm. Birdsong and flowersmells filled the moist air. The
        buildings and settlements also began to take on a
        Southern aspect: shacks on stilts, tin roofs, fridges on
        porches. There were more animals too. Sheep and cattle
        bolted in terror when they saw us, while the goats looked
        at us with relative indifference. Horses and emus were
        thrilled to see us; they ran up to fences to get a better
        look at us, and ran alongside us as far as they could.
        All of this served as much-needed distraction from the
        relentlessly bad weather. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Camp Wood appeared not a
        moment too soon. Fred was beat, so we checked into the
        first place we could find, a newer motel whose office is
        housed in a former gas station (&quot;It was once a Dairy
        Queen, too&quot; explained the manager with peculiar
        pride). Camp Wood&#146;s claim to fame is that Charles
        Lindburgh once crashed his plane into a grocery store
        here; a mock-up of the event protrudes from what is now
        the town&#146;s Chamber of Commerce. A quick walk up and
        down Main Street yielded the disappointing realization
        that Camp Wood and the county which contains it are dry
        as a bone. We were both in the mood for a scotch, but had
        to settle for milkshakes and catfish at the
        hole-in-the-wall café across the street from where
        we&#146;ll be sleeping in just a few minutes&#133; </font></p>

        Wood to the warmest driest place we could find (near
        Hunt), 68 miles</b></font><p><font size="2" face="Arial">A
        day of extremes: My favorite day riding, my least
        favorite day, Hot and sweaty, cold and miserable,
        attaining fastest speed, achieving lowest daily average
        speed.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">It all began in Camp Wood
        at breakfast. Greasy potatoes, badly cooked eggs, cold
        toast, nasty coffee were eaten in the company of people
        with a long history of marrying their cousins. A babbling
        Woodian named Harry, Vern or something like that rolled
        up to the café on his three wheeled bicycle which
        spawned a conversation about biking the challenges that
        lay before us that day. &quot;It isn&#146;t Northern
        California or anything but it is preeety tough,&quot;
        exclaimed our waitress. A prophecy that would turn out to
        be more than true. One funny thing about Camp Wood is
        that everyone we talked to mumbled this disclaimer
        &quot;I am not from Camp Wood, but I live here.&quot;
        Maybe no one was interested in being associated with
        Harry or Vern.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Climbing out of Camp Wood
        at 8:30 it was already hot. Andy took off his shirt and I
        sweat through mine. We welcomed the heat and the sun for
        it was the first time it had reared its head in days. If
        yesterday marked a transition from west to east Texas
        then today marked the true transition into spring. The
        bright orb drenched the green and flowery countryside.
        Sheep bleated, birds chirped, insects lit, and frogs
        croaked. All the while sun crisping Andy&#146;s back and
        shoulders as we made our way over very mean hills and
        ridges to Leaky. (pronounced lee-achy) </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Searching for a lunching
        spot we happened upon the café near the high school.
        Here again Texan children displayed that they have more
        imagination then those from AZ or NM by not saying
        &quot;nuh-uh&quot; when told where we were biking from.
        The catfish special was $4.99, including fried shrimp,
        fried catfish, fried hush puppies, fried fries and,
        fortunately, not-fried salad bar and pineapple upside
        down cake. Andy went into a food coma after lunch and
        missed an important navigational detail we would regret
        later. We rushed out the door, ostensibly with the idea
        we would miss the oncoming WEATHER on its way from Del
        Rio.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Sharp, long, steep, thigh-
        and calf-tearing hills greeted us. The temperature nudged
        its way to 90 degrees as the humidity mounted. Beat and
        tired of the hills we stopped in Vanderpool for a snack.
        As we sipped our water and munched apples two dykes in a
        mini-van pulled up. They were stocking up to backpack
        into Lost Maples park up the road. When we warned them of
        the impending weather disaster the butcher of the two
        women said, &quot;I come here every spring&#133;and every
        year its the same thing, a storm warning. I ignore it and
        sometimes it rains.&quot; -- Words to live by. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Out of V-pool we wound
        along side a charming swift moving river until we
        discovered that the road builders decided that they
        didn&#146;t like the canyon we were in and that we needed
        to climb out of it. I have no argument with their desire
        to change course, however I would tarry over the route --
        this was &quot;the&quot; steepest grade of the trip so
        far. I concentrated on pumping up the hill all the while
        sweat pouring out of my body as though I was in a sauna.
        Not once did I even look back to see Andrew doing the
        same while he periodically glanced back at the horizon
        noting the very pregnant clouds approaching. At the top
        he pointed them out to me and I realized that we were not
        going to have a nice afternoon.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">As we began to realize
        that this was the end of our ride for now, we came upon a
        picnic area complete with a roof (no walls) and table. We
        foresaw the worst; probably we would have to camp here.
        As we strategized, two Canadian couples came up to us and
        began to quiz us about what we were doing and criticized
        our route. This is when Andy realized there might have
        been a better way out of Leaky. Too late to fret.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">When they finally left us
        the wind was whipping through the shelter and it began to
        rain. The wind was so hard it ripped a bag of candy from
        Andrew&#146;s hand, scattered the candy on the lawn and
        sent the bag zipping towards the fence of the rest stop.
        At that moment Andy lost his mind. I thought I was
        dreaming. Andy went skipping out of the shelter into the
        path of the now falling sky after the paper. He
        apparently took &quot;don&#146;t mess with Texas&quot;
        more seriously then necessary. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Now the wind began to blow
        the rain through the shelter horizontally and we sought
        warm clothes from our packs to fight the cold and wet
        bone chilling storm. We had to climb onto the picnic
        table to escape the rain and then only our head and
        shoulders were spared. When marble-sized hail started
        pinging us we became a little worried. Then a miracle
        occurred. The rain stopped as quickly as it had begun,
        only the clouds and wind remained.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Now we had a decision to
        make, should we go back, go forward or hunker-down and
        camp? Not willing to admit defeat we pushed forward.
        Thirty miles to do before the sun was to set (in two
        hours). We rode against the wind up and down more nasty
        hills with dear running along with us past farmers who
        scowled in amazement. Rain fell occasionally and we went
        through water at every low bridge. Darkness was falling,
        I was wet, the hills were unrelenting and I made the big
        mistake. I went down the &quot;what the **** am I doing
        this for?&quot; brain pathway. Just as I was about to
        become a raving maniac we arrived at a deserted country
        resort hotel not unlike the one featured in &quot;The
        Shining&quot;. The office was vacant and there were two
        Hispanic guys throwing pool balls at the walls. They
        grudgingly gave us a room and told us there was no store
        or restaurant within 6 miles. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Before passing out we
        dried our shoes in the oven and ate all of our granola
        bars and trail mix for dinner, thankful we had made it
        through the day and hoping for a better one the next.</font></p>

    <tr>
        <td><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>5 April 1997, Near
        Hunt to Blanco, 91 miles&nbsp;</b></font><p><font size="2" face="Arial">We woke up to a gorgeous day, with
        birds chirping under blue skies. The nearest coffee was
        seven miles down the road in Hunt, in the general
        store/John Wayne shrine. While waiting for breakfast to
        arrive, I looked through a real estate mag featuring
        ranches, and fantasized about having a spread of my own.
        Back on the road, I fantasized some more. Ranches
        announced themselves everywhere with showy gates and
        tree-lined drives. The whole area around Hunt and
        Kerrville appeared to be pretty well-heeled, perhaps a
        hunting playground for rich city folk. The terrain had
        become more civilized, too; our route followed the course
        of the bucolic Guadalupe river with nary a climb. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">In Kerrville we had a
        decision to make. We were both exhausted from the
        previous day and Fred was complaining of a pain in his
        calf. Setting up camp in the riverside Sands motel was
        looking mighty tempting, even though it was still morning
        and we had only ridden twenty miles. The only thing
        keeping me from following this plan of action was a
        tailwind from God, one that could blow us all the way to
        Blanco, some sixty miles distant. After mulling over the
        most expensive espresso this side of Naples, we decided
        to push for Blanco. The weather was too pretty not to be
        riding, and the next twenty miles along the river would
        be a joy.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">--Or so we thought. What
        we hadn&#146;t factored into our decision was the high
        water from the previous day&#146;s storm. Just a few
        miles out of Kerrville, we ran into our first problem:
        the water had risen about a foot and a half above the
        level of the bridge, and was flowing pretty fast. After
        more deliberation, and a trial wade across by me, we
        decided to go for it. Only after we had transported our
        first load across did a big truck show up. The
        truck&#146;s owner was Texas friendly and Internet savvy,
        and offered us a ride across with our bikes. Our trip was
        feeling like an adventure once again. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">We blew into an adorable
        little town called Comfort, and were surprised to find a
        café serving &quot;healthfood&quot; (Amy's Bluestem
        Restaurant); Toto, I have a feeling we&#146;re not in
        West Texas anymore. Our server and chef was called Craig,
        a seriously cute high school senior. He told us all about
        his plans for college and his opinions on various towns
        and regions of the Lone Star State and said he&#146;d
        look us up on the Web. Fred and I rode away wondering if
        we could come back to Comfort to help Craig celebrate his
        eighteenth birthday&#133;</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">From Comfort, hills began
        to reappear, and we had to take a detour around an
        unpassable river crossing. A funny old geezer forded us
        across in his beat-up pickup truck at a calmer, wider
        spot in the Guadalupe, adding ten miles or so to our
        planned itinerary. After chugging over some pretty mean
        hills, we stopped at the general store and bar in
        Sisterdale to reward ourselves with some Texas beer and
        some Texas wine (which was surprisingly drinkable). The
        place was right out of a piece of fiction, full of dudes
        wearing cowboy hats and spurs and speaking
        incomprehensible Texan. The place&#146;s owner was an
        elderly tough-as-nails type woman who had grown up in
        Latvia. When I told her we&#146;d be riding through there
        in August or September, she closed her eyes and said it
        would be pear season then. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">I suffered my first flat
        in a while in front of the gate of a very noisy ranch,
        just after a little altercation with the Butthead Driver
        of the Week (brown Oldsmobile Tornado, Texas handicapped
        plates, 5HPMS) who insisted we had no right riding our
        bikes in the road &#150;our first such incident in Texas,
        surprisingly. These two events, coupled with a bit of
        backtracking due to a missed turn, got us into Blanco a
        bit after sundown. We enjoyed watching the sun set from
        atop our saddles though, and the last twenty miles of the
        day were along a deserted country road that buckled and
        twisted its way through some beautiful hills and more
        than a few frigid streams. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">There wasn&#146;t much to
        Blanco, though it had a genuinely old-time Texan feel to
        it, with a bunch of crumbling buildings organized around
        a square with a hulking old courthouse in the middle of
        it. The only motel in town was a dump, and the menu at
        dinner looked a lot better than the actual food it
        described. Perplexingly, the sun-dried tomatoes in
        Fred&#146;s dish had been fried to a charcoal-like state.
        We were entertained, however, by the arrival of a
        Catholic priest, followed by a man of elaphantine
        proportions in full Orthodox drag. Fred and I
        hypothesized that it was a themed night at the Sunset
        Restaurant and lounge, where patrons in religious
        costumes received a free entree; we never learned if this
        was indeed the case, though the place&#146;s owner
        informed us that our options for night life in Blanco on
        this particular Saturday evening were exactly nil. We
        headed back to the Bates-Motel-the-sequel for a thrilling
        night of t.v. and sleep.</font></p>

        Café, no priests this morning, thank god. As Andy
        chugged his last bit&#146;o&#146;coffee we watched the
        flag swing around on its pole in the square. The day went
        from being &quot;cake&quot; to bad in the time it took
        the wind to shift. Shouldn&#146;t have laughed at the
        religious last night. Hard to concentrate on the beauty
        of the hill country as we slugged it out against stiff
        and gusty winds at our face. I was looking forward to
        making a right turn away from the wind and onto Texas 290
        to finish out our last 30 miles and arrive in Austin.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">290 wasn&#146;t a dream
        date. Four lanes, undivided, small shoulder with a bad
        surface, impatient drivers and still a nasty head wind.
        Stopped at a roadside bakery and met Laura and Anthony.
        Laura was laid-off from Apple was moving to Johnson City
        to live in a barn with an outhouse leaving Anthony in
        Austin. Within two seconds of Anthony offering us a ride
        into Austin (getting us off the nasty and dangerous road)
        we had our bikes in the back of his truck thus forever
        marring the integrity of our coast-to-coast ride.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Now mourning this loss in
        the comfort of our hotel watching the largest urban
        colony of bats leave the Congress Avenue bridge at
        sunset.&nbsp;</font></p>

        and New York were a welcome break from the hardships of
        the road. In New York Fred stayed out late exploring the
        East Village homo scene, while I got up early every
        morning to spend time with the little one, who is more
        amazing than ever. Each time I see him, I am overwhelmed
        by the desire that he won&#146;t change any more and stay
        exactly as he is. Back in Austin, we were hosted by
        extra-friendly Jeff, who even picked us up at the
        airport. We spent a day catching up with our mail and
        bill-paying before dining with Fred&#146;s new friend Tim
        at the bar of a busy restaurant filled with prom-goers
        and assorted trendoids. The two girls seated next to us,
        Dina and Catherine, hit on us mercilessly until we set
        them straight about being queer. They had grown up
        together in a place called Nacogdoches (pronounced
        something like &quot;naked duchess&quot; in Texan) and
        had apparently o.d.&#146;d on estrogen. Dina was the more
        hyper of the two, unable to utter a syllable without <i>scray-ming</i>
        it in her high-decibel twang, and neither of them was
        capable of keeping her hands to herself. They explained
        that it was customary for Texan girls to be friendly
        towards men; Tim calmly verified this claim.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Our hiatus from pedaling
        had lasted nearly a week, and the calluses on our butts
        were anxious to be reunited with our bicycle seats. The
        air was crisp and cold (twenty-five degrees below normal,
        we later learned on the Weather Channel), yet spring was
        in it in the form of pollen. I cried and sniffled all day
        in spite of taking megadoses of Tylenol Allergy-Sinus.
        Biking out of the segregated neighborhoods of Eastern
        Austin, I was reminded of Charlie&#146;s bar the previous
        night, which was neatly divided into Mexican, Asian and
        Black sections. Also striking was how quickly we were in
        the countryside again, surrounded by an extraordinary
        array of wildflowers. The road to Bastrop, where we had
        lunch, was busy and shoulderless and full of butthead
        drivers, but that soon changed, thankfully.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Just out of Bastrop, we
        turned onto a road leading through two state parks, and
        were surprised by the sudden appearance of pine trees and
        legions of other cyclists. The presence of the latter was
        quickly understood, since what followed were fourteen
        miles of sheer cycling joy. Sure, the hills were the
        steepest we had ever seen, but none of them were very
        high (my altimeter showed us gaining and losing the same
        sixty feet over and over), and the many sudden twists and
        dips were thrilling. Nearly every one of the cyclists we
        encountered made the same comment &#150;&quot;You guys
        are really loaded down&quot;&#151;thus exhibiting their
        powerful Texan powers of observation. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Approaching La Grange, we
        encountered our first oil pump of the trip (the kind that
        looks like a giant praying mantis) as well as the first
        billboard advertising alligator meat; we were definitely
        entering new territory. Dinner was at Dairy Queen, which
        was invaded by a group of scary Christians sporting
        rainbow-colored outfits and accessories shortly after we
        arrived. I first mistook them for a gay group, but
        quickly dismissed this possibility based on their
        flamingly heterosexual behavior. They were doubtless just
        another group of pinheads-for-Jesus, oblivious to their
        having borrowed an emblem from the gay movement. Judging
        from the way that one of their adorable offspring hid his
        cross in his shirt and proceeded to flirt with us, they
        may soon have a defector on their hands.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">When we checked into our
        motel, the friendly Gujarati owner gave us news of all
        the cyclists who had recently passed through (including
        the elusive Mike, whom haven&#146;t spotted since the
        very first day in San Diego), and had us sign a special
        guest registry. The best discount I could chisel out of
        him was only two dollars though; he must have sensed that
        we were too exhausted to argue or to seek shelter
        elsewhere.</font></p>

        <td><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>14 April, La Grange to
        Navasota, 72 miles</b></font><p><font size="2" face="Arial">We awoke in our mint green hotel room in La
        Grange. The day was not looking promising. A high ceiling
        of gray clouds and low mercury were in store for us. Had
        a big american breakfast on the town square while the
        locals admired our spandex. Unlike West Texas no one
        asked us where we were from or where we were going. They
        just looked at us quizzically and stared
        unapologetically. The waitress asked us what the
        &quot;Virgin de los Lagos,&quot; the adornment on
        Andy&#146;s handlebar bag, was for. I told her to protect
        and watch over us; somebody had to. She retorted,
        &quot;the good lord is wachin&#146; over you.&quot;</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Apparently he was, because
        the clouds cleared and the temperature mounted. As the
        sky brightened the light played on the hills and
        wildflowers. Globs of pink, yellow, blue, orange and red
        blooms dazzled us while they contemplated what it would
        be like to be cattle food. On our way out of town we
        stopped at the market to pick up some water an met some
        hick who had never heard of our destination for the day,
        and insisted that Houston was only 100 miles from Austin.
        He told us he was working a little down the road, so it
        was no surprise when we ran into him in an extra-cutesy
        little town called Warrington, scraping paint off the
        general store where he still insisted on the proximity of
        Houston. Inside there was an 85 year-old dude warming
        himself by the heater. He kept asking us questions
        through his rotting teeth, tobacco juice dribbling from
        the corner of his mouth. Before we&#146;d have a chance
        to answer he&#146;d giggle at us.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">At the general store Andy
        was in search of electrical tape in order to repair his
        fraying handlebar tape. He spotted a partially used roll
        behind the counter. The septuagenarian cashier
        didn&#146;t not even flinch when he asked for five inches
        of it. She grabbed a whole roll, handed it to him and
        demanded $1.31. A few miles down the road the sprawling
        metropolis of Burton unfolded for us. The town&#146;s
        café looked all too inviting and very promising. It was
        bustling with locals, always a good sign. Our waitress
        was more than a little ditzy and our meal dragged on
        forever. Hanging out for so long we had a chance to get
        some face time the county sheriff who was having lunch
        with his entourage. The five of them probably weighed in
        at nearly a ton. I fell asleep in a food coma at the
        table while Andy was in the bathroom.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">When I regained
        consciousness we were pedaling and my knee was aching.
        The road deteriorated to a bumpy dirt path. We finally
        had to stop when we reached a road crew that had reduced
        the road to loose and large gravel that was impassable by
        bike. We were not looking forward to walking our bikes
        for two miles through the construction site. Luckily, the
        flagman offered to radio for a truck to give us a ride
        through to the other side.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">That got us through that
        little problem but my knee still throbbed and Andrew was
        becoming impatient with my pace. When we stopped at the
        next town we both jumped at the general store&#146;s
        proprietress&#146; idea of how to clip off a few miles
        from our journey. O.K., so it involves a few miles of
        dirt road, but it cuts off 19 miles of the journey, she
        insisted. This didn&#146;t seem really likely because
        there were only 26 miles left on the route prescribed by
        our maps, but sounded good. It worked; we shortened the
        trip (by a mile or two) and the dirt road was fine.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">As we came closer to
        Navasota the color of the in Texas minorities began to
        shift from brown to black. We checked into the hotel of
        the brother or cousin of the hotel operator of last
        night. Before hitting the room we decided that we would
        dine in our biking clothes. Rode to dinner at a
        &quot;B-minus&quot; Mexican restaurant where Andrew
        ordered a meal so large it came on two plates. He ate so
        much he almost re-enacted the much heralded scene from
        Monty Python&#146;s &quot;The Meaning of Life&quot; where
        the restaurant patron explodes. On the way home we bought
        a flask and a bottle of Chivas Regal to help us through
        the last remaining dry counties of Texas. Had a couple of
        scotches and imagined what life in a state other than
        Texas will be like.</font></p>
