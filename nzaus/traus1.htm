        Comboyne, 42km (f)</b></font><p><font size="2" face="Arial">Who&#146;d have thought our day would end up
        this way? Relaxing on the porch of our house, playing
        backgammon, drinking a few cold ones and watching the sky
        perform its nightly lightshow. The day certainly had a
        different beginning.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">First, it had been
        decided, Niels and Tomas were not going to accompany us
        for the rest of our voyage acting a scouts and carrying
        our bags for the rest of the year as we had expected.
        They had more of Australia to see than our measly 100
        kilometers-a-day. Disappointing as it was, we had
        expected this day to come. We&#146;d both become
        accustomed to riding our bikes without baggage to burden
        us. So much so we began to comb through our gear this
        morning for things to lose. We managed to find nearly
        seven kilograms between us to ditch at the post office
        for a slow return trip to the good ol&#146; U.S.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Whatever weight we managed
        to shed the bikes still felt far heavier than the days
        leading up to this one. It was easy to forget the effort
        required to pedal as we marveled at the lush green beauty
        of the rolling hills around Wingham. As lovely as it was
        nothing could make us forget what was in store for us. It
        came as no great surprise: we&#146;d been warned that
        this would be the most difficult day of our trip in
        Australia. What I found was somehow ruder than I
        expected.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">At km 15 the road
        unceremoniously dissolved into a rock and gravel path
        that climbed unrelentingly for kilometers and kilometers.
        We topped out at 765 meters, having started below a
        hundred and ascending over 1000 meters total for the day.
        The bulk of work was on a soft and crunchy track, though
        our guidebook had told us it was to be on a dirt road
        &quot;as good as bitumen.&quot; </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">When we finally made the
        top we didn&#146;t even get the full pleasure of
        descending for the first part of the trip, having to
        negotiate the same winding dirt road down as up. Finally
        we reached pavement and our rattled bones jumped for joy
        as our eyes were treated to the most beautiful
        pastureland I&#146;ve ever seen. We stopped for what we
        thought would be a late lunch at the Udder Cow Café, a
        cute Holstein-influenced watering hole. There we met Sean
        and Kris, an extraordinary couple who worked in a coal
        mine near Newcastle before moving to Comboyne and
        creating a tourist infrastructure in this beautiful
        place. As well as operating the restaurant, they offer
        several options for accommodation, organize adventure
        outings in the surrounding wilderness and provide venues
        for corporate events. <em>(For more information on what
        Sean&#146;s story, and on what wonderful Comboyne has to

        wwwxxxyyyzzz.)</em> Sean --an inveterate entrepreneur--
        made us an offer we couldn&#146;t refuse: a free night in
        a nearby house he owned if we&#146;d write a little pitch
        for him on our page. &quot;Yes!&quot; was all we could
        manage when we thought about it for two seconds. The idea
        of washing off the salty crust that enveloped our bodies
        sounded great. The place turned out to be wonderful and
        charming. At the back of our house a hardwood deck looked
        out on the pastures. There we whiled away the hours
        before sunset before treating Andrew to his first RSL
        Club experience. After that perhaps he&#146;ll understand
        what real rural Australia is all about.</font></p>

        South West Rocks, 127km (a)</b></font><p><font size="2" face="Arial">The RSL club (Returning Services League) was
        truly an experience, though not quite as raucous as I had
        expected for a Friday night out at the only bar in town.
        We found Sean sitting with his friend Lenore, a lifelong
        Comboynian who works at the local cheese factory. Her
        kids were there too, kept in the larger hall area in back
        of us by an invisible fence. All the pubs we&#146;ve seen
        in this country are loosely divided into a series of
        rooms or areas. Some areas are more family-oriented than
        others, and kids are always forbidden access to the room
        holding the inevitable row of slot machines. RSL clubs
        impose yet another rule requiring any non-member to be
        sponsored by a member. Sean signed us in the big book at
        the entrance, just to make it official. He introduced us
        to another friend who had recently moved to Comboyne from
        Sydney. In stark contrast to the drunken farmers sitting
        at the bar, she was stylishly dressed, articulate and
        instantly friendly, explaining to us some of the
        complications of local politics. Noticing a few hostile
        looks coming from the bar crowd, I wondered how much Sean
        and his bunch are considered pariahs in this traditional
        little place. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The nightly dinner special
        was only five aussie dollars, served up by a pair of
        friendly women in the kid room. One was about two hundred
        pounds overweight, while the other&#146;s upper plate of
        dentures kept slipping as she chastised the boy in front
        of me for driving too fast the other day with only a
        &quot;P&quot; permit (new drivers aren&#146;t allowed to
        exceed 80 km/h, I learned). As we waited for our food,
        the night&#146;s big event began: the weekly meat raffle,
        in which two men (presumably officers in the club
        hierarchy) drew numbers and announced winners over a P.A.
        system with great ceremony. Prizes included a pound of
        ground chuck, lamb chops, steaks and pigs feet &#150;all
        wrapped up in cellophane just like in the supermarket. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">This morning served up
        more country fun. It&#146;s the annual Comboyne
        &quot;show&quot; &#150;a country fair and exposition.
        Sean said he&#146;d be there in a cow suit promoting his
        café, but we were disappointed to learn he had run into
        town (Port Macquarie) on an errand. Kristine predicted
        that old Noel at the gate would let us in for free, and
        she was right; we were waved through without hesitation.
        We were there a little early, but did get a chance to see
        everyone setting up their displays, including the brave
        local firemen dressing up a mannequin in firefighting
        gear. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Not far out of town the
        road dropped precipitously. It wasn&#146;t a very
        satisfying descent, hurting my hands from squeezing the
        brakes so hard. At the bottom, after meeting Sean on his
        way back to Comboyne, we stopped for a second breakfast
        at a funky café and art gallery amid a little cluster of
        houses known as Byabarra. Our hosts &#150;Alan and
        Frith&#150; were distinctly hippyesque in appearance, and
        a tad less capitalistic in their approach than their
        Comboynian counterpart. Both the food and the art were
        surprisingly good. In a flowing dress and wild hair,
        fifty-ish Frith described for us her lifelong dream and
        ambition to drive a herd sheep on horseback across
        Australia to Perth. &quot;Isn&#146;t it kinda dry and
        boring in the middle?&quot; I asked incredulously.
        &quot;Oh we&#146;d just ride around that part,&quot; came
        the blithe response. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The next fifty kilometers
        undulated wildly through forests and fields, never giving
        us a chance to catch our breath with a flat stretch. We
        rejoined the Pacific Highway at a place called Telegraph
        Point, steeling ourselves for the worst. With a strong
        tailwind, we made good time on a 30km piece of road
        remarkable only for its heavy traffic, comparatively
        civilized grades and exotic marsupial roadkill. Sean had
        described Kempsey as &quot;a shithole&quot;; Frith called
        it a &quot;slum&quot; and our guidebook referred to it as
        &quot;a large town.&#146;&#146; We took their words for
        it and skirted the city&#146;s center before heading back
        into green cow pastures, once again along country roads. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">We arrived in dinky
        Gladstone exhausted and famished, urgently seeking the
        café Frith had recommended, in an old Masonic lodge
        attractively situated on the banks of the Macleay River.
        My mouth watered in anticipation of the salmon crostini I
        had selected from the menu. Then a bimboid waitress
        materialized to take our order and informed us that only
        tea was served at this late hour. After a tasty but
        unsatisfying late lunch of carrot cake and iced coffee,
        Fred changed a flat tire (his first since leaving the
        States) while I checked out the beds at the local pub
        &#150;Gladstone&#146;s only accommodation. Initially we
        had thought we&#146;d camp out tonight, but a ripping
        wind and threatening skies made us postpone yet again.
        Besides, I have wanted to spend at least one night in a
        traditional &quot;hotel&quot; (Australian for bar) since
        arriving here. So it was with bitter disappointment that
        I discovered the beds to be entirely unsleepable. While
        the $10 price tag was certainly attractive, the thought
        of sleeping in a hammock-shaped bag of springs was not.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Wearily, we remounted our
        bikes to head for the nearest real beds, in South West
        Rocks over 20km away. Thankfully, it was mostly downwind
        and pancake flat, following the course of the wide river
        through fields of startled-looking cows.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">After hearing several
        people wax rhapsodically on the place, South West Rocks
        came as a bit of a disappointment. The place reeks of
        downmarket holiday paradise, a prefab little town with
        little to offer beyond a beachside setting. We found a
        sleazy overpriced room in a hotel whose most interesting
        feature was that reception doubled as a liquor store
        (&quot;bottle shop&quot; in local lingo). At least it had
        decent beds&#133;</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Also decent was the
        Chinese dinner we wolfed down. Afterwards, we thought
        we&#146;d check out the local pub (conveniently located
        in the same complex as our lodgings), but we turned
        around after just one peek. The place looked like
        purgatory and the only sound we heard when we entered was
        a thundering belch that was most likely manufactured as a
        greeting to us. Deciding to forego SWR&#146;s elegant
        nightlife, we retreated to our cavernous hole of a room
        for a glass of scotch and an initiation to the televisual
        joys of &quot;Xena: Warrior Princess.&quot; </font></p>

    <tr>
        <td><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>8 March, South West
        Rocks to Coffs Harbour, 114km (f)</b></font><p><font size="2" face="Arial">I&#146;d thought I&#146;d never
        hear the words from Andrew, &quot;Let&#146;s just take
        the main highway.&quot; But I did this day. We awoke in
        SWR to the sound of gulls. In fact I&#146;d woken up in
        the middle of the night to the sound of drunks returning
        home from a rough night in the pub. The knocked on each
        door of the hotel looking for their friends and then had
        a row about the amount of noise they were making. Reminds
        me of college days and nights. In fact the whole of
        Australia seems as though it is governed by Frat Boy
        values. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">When we finally got
        ourselves on the road we had to backtrack 11 kilometers
        to make it back to the turnoff towards the main highway.
        All the way we fought the sturdy wind that had blown us
        home the night before. As we turned onto Highway 1 and
        the wind blew us down the road, Andy suggested taking the
        most direct route, on the Highway to Coffs Harbour.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">At first the road was
        quiet with a big shoulder, leaving us to appreciate the
        grassy meadows and hilly gum forests against a big blue
        cloudless sky. Slowly the wind died and left us pushing
        ourselves along up and down the hilly terrain.
        Complicating matters further the road periodically
        narrowed, leaving us in the lanes of the increasingly
        busy highway.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Thankfully Macksville came
        along, where we&#146;d planned a lunch stop. There we sat
        on the veranda overlooking the river, drinking beer,
        munching calamari and hanging with the locals. A young
        couple gave us advice on a route, suggesting we avoid the
        much-heralded town called Nimbin in favor of the trendy
        beach station of Byron Bay. Andy really wanted to see the
        Marijuana museum, but they convinced us otherwise,
        telling us that the only real attraction was &quot;feral
        hippies&quot; --and we&#146;d certainly had enough
        experience with those back in Santa Cruz.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">After achieving a mild
        beer-buzz we decided to get off the big road and head for
        the hills. We wound around up and down trying to spot a
        koala or two in the trees. It was nice to be able to
        concentrate on something other than where your wheels are
        rolling and how close cars are coming to you for a little
        while.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Our blissful rest from the
        highway soon came to an end and we were back on bad
        ol&#146; one again. Andy figured out a way to get off the
        road once again, though it would take us 6 kilometers
        instead of three on the main road. A small price to pay
        for the peace. There were more than a few surprises on
        the route. Just a few hundred meters off the road we saw
        a family of roos boinging along. It was only our second
        live kangaroo sighting this trip. Another bonus was the
        view of the coast when we reached Hungry Head. White
        sands stretched in either direction as far as the eye
        could see. Just before rejoining the wretched road we
        stopped for a snack in Uranga, where we almost stopped
        for the evening. Instead we continued onward, both
        anxious to see a little urban culture after so many
        nights in small towns.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The highway was even more
        bothersome than before, but we had a little stroke of
        luck. A long new stretch of highway was just about to be
        opened and we managed to sneak onto it. Two lanes in each
        direction were reserved only for BikeBrats usage this
        day. Because it was a Sunday there were no roadworkers to
        contend with either. After only 5 or so kilometers we
        were back on the evil road again. The traffic was still
        bad and the road was worse, shoulder-free as it wound
        through eucalyptus forests. Both of us were literally run
        off the road by trucks more than once on this segment.
        Finally we found our turnoff to Coffs Harbour and
        meandered through the suburbs before finally reaching our
        destination. Riding our bikes through the Palm Court, the
        central mall, we were disturbed to find the town
        completely empty. This was supposed to be one of the
        biggest towns on the coast. It must be pretty big because
        it had the biggest Ex-Services Club I&#146;d ever seen.
        Across the street from the club was a men&#146;s
        hairdresser named &quot;Peter Titcum&quot; which was next
        door to the &quot;New Start for Under Achievers
        Foundation&quot; --giving you some idea of the
        possibilities in Coffs Harbor.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">We found a great dinner at
        the local pub. A pair of Thais had rented out the
        &quot;bistro&quot; (every pub has one) and were serving
        simple meals of composed of very fresh ingredients.
        Hopefully this would be a preview of our times to come in
        Asia. We washed it down with a beer, of course, and
        treated ourselves to a free game of pool.</font></p>

        Harbour to Grafton, 85km (a)</b></font><p><font size="2" face="Arial">Yesterday&#146;s break from riding was
        essential and went very quickly. As far as we were able
        to discover, there&#146;s not much to Coffs Harbour
        beyond a great climate, a couple of decent beaches, and a
        forlorn pedestrian mall peopled principally by derelicts.
        The town&#146;s premier tourist attraction is the
        &quot;Big Banana,&quot; a giant fiberglass replica of the
        region&#146;s chief crop. Neither of us had the energy to
        do anything beyond laundry, phone calls and a short visit
        to the beach (where we yoga&#146;d while watching three
        kookaburras compete over a still-writhing snake). </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Today was another story.
        We woke up early, delighted to see that the southerly
        wind had lasted through the night. Hitting the road at
        the unusually early hour of 9am, we cycled out of town
        over a steep ridge. The climb caused our energy and
        enthusiasm to flag only temporarily, for today&#146;s
        route was easily the most cycle-friendly road we&#146;ve
        seen thus far in Australia: a good surface, rolling
        hills, pretty countryside, and &#150;most
        importantly&#151;a dearth of motorized traffic. The only
        disappointment was the lack of kangaroos and other
        marsupials live or flattened. A woman who runs a gas
        station in the middle of nowhere (literally) told us you
        usually see them early in the morning or at dusk, and
        that the big ones can get quite aggressive. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Stopping only a few times
        along the way for cold drinks, we made it to our
        destination in time for a late lunch at a funky old
        pub/hotel on the banks of the surprisingly wide Clarence
        River. While we thought we&#146;d spend the night in a
        campground listed in the Spartacus Guide (which sounded
        kinda intriguing), the riverside location won us over.
        Tonight&#146;s action-packed agenda includes a walk
        around this supposedly historic town (&quot;oldest city
        on the Northern Coast&quot; proclaims the sign coming
        into town) and another sunset bat vigil. The local
        tourist literature hyperbolically describes the flying
        fox colony here as &quot;largest in the southern
        hemisphere,&quot; thus explaining why all the fruit
        orchards we passed today were entirely enclosed in
        netting. </font></p>

        Casino, 106km (f)</b></font><p><font size="2" face="Arial">I awoke early to the sound of the tradesmen
        starting their trucks. Miraculously I was able to rouse
        Andy early and we had our breakfast before seven and were
        on the road before eight. Leaving Grafton was somewhat
        harder than finding it. In trying to find a more quiet
        road out of town we got lost and had to backtrack to the
        main drag out of town. At first I was a bit worried about
        the amount of traffic though it died down to but a few
        cars within a few kilometers of the highway.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Today&#146;s trip was to
        be a very quiet one. There was one town of consequence
        between Grafton and Casino. Otherwise there were just
        farms and forest. I&#146;d hoped to see a couple of big
        kangaroos but the noisy squeaking of Andy&#146;s loose
        front rack scared all the animals away. In spite of the
        racket I heard the sing-song chirping of the birds and
        not much else for the first half of the day. Blue skies
        dotted with occasional clouds overhead, we sped across
        the vacant countryside. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">As we arrived in the only
        civilization between our starting point and destination
        &#150;a three house &quot;town&quot; called Whiporie--
        the sun was just getting hot and it seemed time to take a
        break. We purchased some water and snacks from the least
        social store operator we&#146;d met in Australia.
        Normally clerks in general stores are likely as not to
        tell you their whole life story just after you say hello
        to them. This clerk grimaced, showing his rotting teeth
        and was not really very welcoming. The warmest moment was
        when he dressed me down for not knowing that the covered
        oil barrel in front of the store was actually a trashcan.
        He stopped short of punctuating his sentence with
        &quot;stupid&quot;.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The latter part of the day
        was spent riding through more lovely territory. Far less
        hilly than the early morning and equally untrafficked it
        was easy to retreat inward and spend some time in my
        inner space. The mounting heat helped me space out. I
        found myself just a little homesick, if that is the right
        term. Not sure exactly where home is at the moment but I
        am missing in some small way Americans and American
        culture. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Before I managed to dwell
        on that thought for too long we&#146;d made it into
        Casino. Casino was actually named for one of the founding
        fathers of the town whose name was actually Cassino.
        Casino is the capital of beef farming in the west we were
        later told by Kim the helpful tourist information
        officer. Kim is actually not a worker in the tourist
        office, however she is a Noxious Weeds Inspector. We
        weren&#146;t sure exactly what that meant, but assumed
        she&#146;d be better located in Nimbin amongst the
        &quot;feral hippies&quot; with a job title like that. The
        Noxious Weeds Authority shares their offices and function
        with the tourist office. They are charged with ensuring
        that farmers control the spread of foreign introduced
        flora and making sure foreign fauna can find the sights
        in Casino. Kim and her coworker agreed that Casino is
        probably the most boring place in Australia in one
        sentence and somehow convinced themselves that it has a
        bit of everything in the next.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Kim&#146;s hospitality was
        unparalleled. She invited us to spend the night out at
        her place in the country within a few moments of meeting
        her. The only problem was that her place was about 30k
        beyond Casino and we were about to expire from heat
        exhaustion. We found the best option to be crashing at
        the &quot;Beef Capital Motel&quot; across the street from
        the public pool, taking a dip and having a nap.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">We had the misfortune of
        missing the big event of the year in Casino. &quot;Beef
        Week&quot; features such exciting events as the Beef
        Ball, Fashion Parades, Beerfest and the famed &quot;Hoof
        and Hook&quot; contest. The latter is a contest among
        young people who lovingly raise cattle for a show where
        the cow is judged for its looks. Kim the noxious weed
        inspector told us that the cow virtually becomes a member
        of the family and is cared for as a sibling.
        Unfortunately for the cow and the family the last part of
        the judgement of the event is how good the beast tastes.</font></p>

        Byron Bay, 86km (a)</b></font><p><font size="2" face="Arial">In the cow country to the northeast of town,
        we ran across Kim on her way to work. Smiling broadly,
        she bounded out of her truck and quizzed us on our plans.
        She even gave us a bit of her life story, how she moved
        up from The Entrance near Sydney, and came up north in
        search of an agricultural job. Being a noxious weeds
        inspector can&#146;t be beat, she explained: &quot;I can
        wake up and go to work when I like, and drive around in
        my government-paid truck wherever I please. I get to
        hassle anyone I want to about clearing weeds off their
        land, and when I don&#146;t feel like seeing anyone I can
        go way into the national parks and write up the rangers.
        I love it.&quot; In mentioning her husband, she answered
        a couple of questions we&#146;d been musing upon since
        yesterday. When we told her we&#146;d most likely head
        for trendy Byron Bay over extra-crunchy Nimbin, she
        maintained we&#146;d still get to see plenty of hippies.
        &quot;Lots of ferals in Byron Bay, too. Just keep an eye
        on your bicycles.&quot; Fred and I could have spent hours
        by the side of the road with this wonderfully
        enthusiastic creature, but at 8:30am, the sun was already
        baking down on us. Puffing up the three nasty hills that
        lie between Casino and Lismore, I felt like a stick of
        butter in a hot skillet. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Lismore struck both of us
        as surprisingly vibrant and bustling, yet we didn&#146;t
        stop to tarry in this agricultural and educational
        center, anxious to get our butts on the beach in Byron
        Bay. To reach our destination, we followed an amazingly
        quiet series of narrow country lanes, with nary a car in
        sight for nearly fifty kilometers. As we approached the
        sea, the terrain became progressively hillier, but the
        steep climbs were shaded for the most part, and the views
        from the top over the rolling fields, orchards and woods
        were spectacular. Butterflies danced under a perfect
        partly cloudy sky; birds of every color flew and squawked
        everywhere, and the breeze blew deliciously through the
        leaves of exotic trees. In cycling nirvana, I kept
        hearing the first strains of Beethoven&#146;s sixth
        symphony swell inside my head. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Eventually our path led us
        back to civilization, which materialized in the form of a
        crossroads general store just steps away from the
        too-familiar drone of the Pacific Highway. We stopped for
        our first-ever taste of jaffles, an Australian snack food
        consisting of stuffed toast pockets. Not exactly gourmet
        dining, but better than your average gas station fare,
        and filling. The friendly, slightly hippiesque woman
        behind the counter counseled us on the best route to
        Byron Bay, which avoided New South Wales&#146; Pacific
        Coast Highway entirely, but contained yet more evil
        hills. The narrow strip of bitumen went straight up to
        the top of a hill, then plunged 150 meters to a broad,
        flat marsh, only to climb steeply into the forest again.
        After repeating this process several times, we found
        ourselves panting on the outskirts of Byron Bay. We
        stopped at a B&amp;B sporting a queer flag and checked
        out the premises. An obviously stoned young lad called
        Paul explained he was running the place while the owner
        was out of town. He showed us a pretty basic room and
        told us we&#146;d be the only guests. Tempting as the
        swimming pool in the yard looked to us, the rest of the
        place smelled like a broken in bong, and had a lugubrious
        air to it. We wisely decided to investigate our options
        in town and were soon checked into the first glamorous
        digs we&#146;ve indulged in since arriving in the
        Antipodes almost a month ago. After a seemingly endless
        string of basic motel rooms, our huge and elegantly
        appointed room at the Beach Hotel feels like heaven. And
        since Byron Bay most likely marks the end of our tour in
        this part of the world (the road from here to Brisbane
        through Surfers Paradise sounds like Cyclists Hell), we
        feel like we deserve it.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">After a couple of hours of
        indulging in our hotel&#146;s amenities, Fred and I felt
        fresh enough for a walk around this extra-groovy little
        beachside resort. Kim was right: the &quot;ferals&quot;
        are out in full force. Smells of patchouli, incense and
        dope waft through the main street, whereupon an endless
        stream of barefoot, dreadlocked, surfboard-toting,
        tattooed, body-pierced humanity parades back and forth
        along its two-block length. Filth-encrusted didgery-do
        players compete with acid house music blaring out of Sri
        Lankan noodle houses, taco stands and cappuccino houses;
        and all the dogs here sport bandanas. Though perhaps a
        bit too poser-y for my tastes, I find it all to be
        tremendously refreshing after ten days in the
        totalitarian ethos of the Australian hinterland, which
        tends to feel like a giant frat party. </font></p>

        <td><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>14 March, Byron Bay to
        Brisbane (f)</b></font><p><font size="2" face="Arial">Waking
        before the alarm I spent the first moments of the day on
        the balcony staring out at the steel blue and pink sea
        reflecting the morning sky. As amusing and comfortable as
        it was, I was ready to leave Byron Bay this morning. Andy
        was just a little bit harder to rouse for we&#146;d both
        slept fitfully in the oppressive humidity and stillness
        complicated by slight sunburns and the noisy revelry of
        the bongo banging wanderers on the beach. I was a little
        embarrassed over misreading the opening time of the
        breakfast room. We arrived there a half-hour before they
        began to serve but used the time to pack up for our trip
        to Brisbane. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">We ate while reading the
        increasingly alarming reports over the political and
        economic situation at our next country of destination.
        Suharto and his regime are coming under increasing
        criticism for their governance, alleged corruption and
        handling of the recent and perilous fall of the rupiah in
        Indonesia. The Australian press detailed the plans for
        their ex-pats to escape if the need became real and we
        began to question the logic of our itinerary. At the same
        time I find myself longing to shrug the comfort of
        traveling in the former colonies of the British and have
        a real adventure.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Today, our trip to
        Brisbane has nothing to do with adventure or intrigue.
        The closest we come to excitement is our debate as to
        whether we&#146;ll have to disassemble the bikes to load
        them on the bus to the capital of Queensland. We arrive
        at the bus station before nine and the sun is already so
        hot and the air humid I must change into a tank top to
        avoid drowning in my sweat. Though the town is seemingly
        dominated by tattooed, pierced, dope smoking and
        patchouli drenched hippies the bus station is populated
        only by squeaky-clean tourists. Perhaps there is a
        &quot;hippy only&quot; service later, maybe that is why
        the ticket clerk wouldn&#146;t sell Andy a ticket on the
        eleven a.m. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The bus ride is
        unremarkable save for the huge tracks of tall apartment
        blocks in Surfers Paradise and the perilously narrow
        un-shouldered highway we avoided riding by and on. The
        suburbs of Brisbane begin far from the city and it is
        obvious that we are entering a city of consequence. I
        remembered having a fun time the last time I was in town
        with Mike, now nearly a decade ago. We&#146;d arrived at
        night, had dinner and stayed out until dawn carousing
        with newfound friends. We piled into the van and made our
        way south that day, barely able to keep our eyes open.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Fatigue and heat both
        troubled us today as we rode into town. Our path took us
        through a street bazaar where Irish folk singers crooned
        in celebration of St. Patties&#146; day. We stopped for
        sushi in honor of the event, neither being fans of the
        holiday or its revelers. Soon we arrived at our digs in
        Brisbane in a quiet little neighborhood called New Farm.
        At the Edward Lodge Gary, our host Gary treated us to a
        most comprehensive orientation to the city and pointed us
        in the direction of where Andrew could finally see a
        koala bear. To our grave disappointment our trek to the
        old Brisbane World Expo Grounds was fruitless. Though the
        bears were still present at the mini-zoo, the place was
        closed indefinitely due to unprofitability. The animal
        keeper outside didn&#146;t respond well to either of my
        suggestions &#150; selling us a koala or sneaking us in
        to see them.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Instead we walked the
        massive Victoria Street Mall, fighting the US Navy for
        tacky souvenirs. A massive aircraft carrier had docked
        and the boys (and I suppose girls, although they are not
        as obvious) were out in force. It had been a long time
        since we&#146;d had a &quot;night out on the town,&quot;
        so we made our way back to the guesthouse for a disco-nap
        in preparation.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">All in all Brisbane is far
        more to my taste than Sydney. The folks here are as
        charming and approachable as in the countryside and there
        is none of the pretense I find so boring in Sydney.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">We&#146;ve become
        accustomed to Australian hyperbole. I am almost to the
        point of not noticing that every town, restaurant,
        street, house, tree, dog, cat or anything else always has
        an adjective with &quot;est&quot; attached to it. Tonight
        we went to the Wickham Hotel (Hotel = drinking bar) the,
        of course, oldest gay drinking hotel in Brisbane. The
        crowd spilled into the street and the music could be
        heard blocks away. As we arrived three really beefy
        security guards were expelling a drunkard. I became a
        little alarmed when the biggest and butchest of the
        three, a platinum blond bull-dyke with a flat-top,
        accosted me upon my approach. &quot;Have you been here
        before?&quot; she asked. Wasn&#146;t sure how to answer
        this but her posture dictated that it should be sincere,
        deferring and respectful if I wanted to live through the
        experience. &quot;Yes&quot;, turned out to be a good
        answer and she stepped aside. I wanted to ask her why she
        stopped me. Did I look that straight, dangerous or drunk?
        I couldn&#146;t find her to ask her but it kept me on
        guard throughout the evening.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Later we met several
        Brisbanians who all approached us for some reason or
        another. The second, a straight girl, Rebecca, out
        dancing with her brother Jason. She and his friends gave
        us a Brisbane nightlife primer. Their friend John took a
        liking to Andy, who was able to see past some really
        nasty facial bruises and cuts to his charms. Seems John
        had a bad night drinking and fell down a flight of stairs
        a few days before, thus our nickname for him
        &quot;escalier boy&quot;. Walking home I found myself,
        for the first time in days, not moist with sweat. The
        evening air cooled me as I walked the empty streets
        leaving me to wonder about our days ahead in Asia.</font></p>
