        Germany to Vordingberg/Copenhagen, Denmark, 95km</b></font><p><font size="2" face="Arial">How excellent it felt to be on my
        way<b> </b>to Denmark, aboard an overcrowded boat full of
        duty-free shoppers and a segmented train on its way from
        Paris. The ride from Grossenbrode to Puttgarden was
        painless, and the big puffy clouds looked like a Turner
        painting. Plus there was the added satisfaction of
        arriving in a Danish port called Rodbyhavn, which is
        written with a line through the &quot;O.&quot; I had made
        it to Northern Europe, and would soon be seeing my
        friends Niels, Eva and Freddy<i> </i>Copenhagen. The only
        other cyclists who had boarded with me were a trio of
        beefy German lads. When I remarked upon their lack of
        gear, they explained that they were only going to the
        beach for the day. &quot;But aren&#146;t there beaches
        just as good on the German side?&quot; I asked.
        &quot;Yes, but there aren&#146;t any Danish girls on
        them,&quot; the most oafish of the three stated
        lasciviously, practically licking his chops, nearly
        causing me to gag. Yes, I thought, as superlative as
        yesterday&#146;s riding had been, I was happy to be
        leaving the Bundesrepublik. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">My first impressions of
        Scandinavia &#150;which I have always considered the
        pinnacle of the civilized world&#151;weren&#146;t
        overwhelmingly favorable. Well-marked cycle tracks led me
        through mostly nondescript villages as I traversed the
        islands of Lolland, Falster and Masnede. Outside a café
        in Sakskobing (yes, with a line through the
        &quot;o&quot;), I saw a sign advertising coffee and
        kringle for fifteen crowns, and promptly decided to take
        the plunge. I was familiar with kringle from Racine,
        Wisconsin, where the sticky Danish pastry is lauded as
        this rustbelt city&#146;s chief cultural contribution,
        emblematic of its connections to the Old Country. Aside
        from &quot;tak,&quot; &quot;kringle&quot; was the only
        Danish word I knew. I marched inside and ordered my
        coffee and kringle with confidence, amused by the
        boisterousness surrounding me. Every person in the place
        was hopelessly inebriated, even though it was only 2pm. I
        guess happy hour starts early in Denmark. I basked in the
        decidedly un-German ambiance as I sipped my coffee,
        wondering what could be taking so long with the kringle.
        More than once I asked the bartendress, &quot;What about
        that kringle?&quot; to which she smiled and said,
        &quot;yes,&quot; only to leave me and serve the next
        customer. Finally I had to resort to pointing to the
        sign, saying &quot;kringle&quot; with every possible
        inflection before she brought a piece out for me. I
        learned later from Niels that &quot;kringle&quot; does
        not rhyme with &quot;shingle,&quot; as I had been taught,
        but sounds more like &quot;strangled.&quot; I also
        learned that &quot;cykyl&quot; &#150;meaning bike&#151;is
        pronounced similarly to the English word
        &quot;sugar.&quot; This dispelled any further attempts to
        learn Danish on my part. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Niels also explained to me
        that Lolland is the &quot;social disaster of
        Denmark&quot;, with the country&#146;s highest
        unemployment rate (not to mention the ugliest scenery).
        While it didn&#146;t exactly look like Detroit, it&#146;s
        true that the area didn&#146;t meet my expectations of
        Danishness either. The houses and villages seemed devoid
        of character and the people didn&#146;t seem to have that
        golden, privileged look I associate with Scandinavians.
        And the landscape didn&#146;t come close to matching up
        with the skyscape, which was growing more dramatic by the
        minute. While crossing the verylong bridge to Seeland
        (Denmark&#146;s largest island, and home to Copenhagen),
        rain started pissing down on me. I had intended to make
        it all the way to Koge, essentially a suburb of
        Copenhagen, but a few miles out of Vordingborg I saw that
        the main road didn&#146;t have a cycle path, and that
        bikes were rerouted along a much longer route. Normally,
        I wouldn&#146;t have a problem with this, but I was
        expected in Copenhagen in 3 ½ hours, so I turned tail
        for Vordingborg&#146;s train station. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The train wasn&#146;t for
        another hour, prompting me to expose myself to yet
        another taste of Danish bar culture. The Amigo Bar was a
        much classier operation than the hole back on Lolland.
        Most customers were watching the Tour de France on a
        giant television, before the broadcast switched to
        outrageously dull live feed covering Air Force One
        leaving Copenhagen airport. Two jolly Danes playing a
        dice game called Chicago informed me that Clinton&#146;s
        visit was the first by an American president in many
        decades, and that the whole country was consumed by
        Clinton fever. One of them told me how much he loved
        America and how sad he found it that our social system
        was such a mess. He told me how he had wept the day
        Kennedy died and gave me a big sentimental hug when I
        left to catch my train.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The train was full of
        other cyclists, as well of Danes of every ilk. Most of
        them had removed their shoes and were munching messily on
        snacks. Niels&#146; much espoused theory that Denmark is
        the Italy of Scandinavia appeared to be an astute one.
        All the passengers were chatting loudly and behaving as
        if they were in their living rooms at home. I was
        surprised when the couple across from me produced a child
        from nowhere over an hour into the voyage. Apparently
        they had left her in the baggage car along with their
        bikes, which reminded me of the story of the Danish
        couple who had recently been arrested in New York for
        leaving their baby in his stroller on the sidewalk while
        they shopped. I didn&#146;t mention this, though, hoping
        they&#146;d help me unload my beast when we arrived in
        Copenhagen, and quietly delighting in the remarkably
        casual attitude with which the Danes appear to approach
        everything.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">I found my way to
        Niels&#146; place without the aid of the map, having been
        there twice before. He lives in what he claims is
        &quot;the gayest street in Copenhagen,&quot; just above a
        bar, a sauna and a leather boutique. It felt great to be
        in familiar surroundings. Promptly I was whisked off to
        Thomas&#146; house, past the debris-strewn square where
        Clinton had made his speech only hours before. Thomas is
        slight and blond and interested in politics. Two
        remarkable sisters were there, too, who had spent a lot
        of time in America. The younger of the two, Trini, is a
        professional fencer &#150;a fact which I found thrilling.
        It felt gloriously homey after so many days feeling
        alienated and alone. We munched on salmon and vegetables
        and talked about everything imaginable before trundling
        into a pair of taxis that took us to a place called PAN,
        Copenhagen&#146;s principal gay disco. I ran into my
        friend Darren there almost instantly (he&#146;s received
        a prestigious grant to write a book on the state of
        so-called &quot;gay marriages&quot; in Denmark, the lucky
        bastard), but I was too beat to hold an intelligent
        conversation or to enjoy myself in any other way, and was
        soon pleading Niels to take me back to his ranch. We had
        a full day ahead of us, after all.</font></p>

        <td><font size="2" face="Arial"><b>13 July, Eva, Freddy
        and Niels&#146; Exclusive North Seeland Bike Tour, 74km</b></font><p><font size="2" face="Arial">It was everything I had hoped and
        more. It was the reason I had rushed up to Copenhagen.
        Eva had long been promising me an unforgettable tour of
        the glories North of Copenhagen, and even back in the
        States it had sounded deliciously tempting. I especially
        liked the idea of being led around without any concern
        for the route, placing all my faith in my able guides.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The activity-packed day
        began promptly at nine a.m. Niels and I set out under a
        cloudless sky along the deserted streets of Copenhagen
        towards Eva and Freddy&#146;s. Thankfully there was
        coffee waiting for us (or for me rather, as Niels is a
        tea drinker, which causes me to suspect he&#146;s
        actually an alien in Viking drag), as well as the most
        sumptuous brunch spread I&#146;ve ever seen on this side
        of the Atlantic. Sitting in the garden of Freddy and
        Eva&#146;s perfect little house and wolfing down pancakes
        in the glistening sunlight was almost enough to make me
        think that there is a God. I could have stayed there all
        day, but of course other arrangements had been made, and
        soon we were all pedaling Northwards.
        Seven-months-pregnant Eva displayed a Viking-like
        constitution, undaunted by the many kilometers that lay
        ahead.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">My hosts kept a running
        commentary. &quot;This woods belonged to the kings of
        Denmark before and have never been forested,&quot; Freddy
        would tell me. &quot;Tyco Brahe lived on that island out
        there,&quot; Eva pointed out. &quot;Just ahead on the
        right is THE gay beach of Copenhagen,&quot; Niels
        informed. We stopped at the Karen Blixen Museum to wander
        around the garden and view the famous author&#146;s
        simple grave. I thought of Meryl Streep shooting lions
        and bonking Robert Redford, my Danish cultural knowledge
        woefully lacking. Our second stop was at the home of
        Niels&#146; parents, who welcomed us warmly and gushed to
        me about how much they liked the U.S. (In their many
        travels they have obviously learned that Americans never
        tire of hearing foreigners praise the merits of the Home
        of the Brave). Niels&#146; dad reminded me a lot of my
        own father, right down to his enthusiasm for computer
        technology. Again, I would have been happy to tarry here
        for hours, but we had a tight schedule to keep&#133;</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The world-famous Louisiana
        Museum for Modern Art was only a few minutes away, and in
        this gorgeously situated place we viewed a huge and
        ambitious exhibition on art in L.A. from 1960 to the
        present called &quot;Sunshine and Noir.&quot; I was more
        impressed than Freddy, who stated that he was more fond
        of creative output that served a more practical function,
        like industrial design.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">From here it was on to
        Helsingor, of &quot;Hamlet&quot; fame. Looming over the
        town was the enormous castle built to collect a tax on
        all passing ships. Sweden lay across the straits, close
        enough to swim to. We stopped for monster-sized ice cream
        cones topped with jam and smushed chocolate-covered
        marshmallow things before continuing northwards past
        streets called &quot;Opheliaveg&quot; and
        &quot;Poloniusstrade&quot; and suchlike. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">We arrived right on time
        for our meal at what must surely rank among
        Denmark&#146;s most extraordinary culinary experiences,
        Jan Hurtigkarl &amp; Co. The chef here takes an extended
        trip each winter, when the restaurant is closed, and
        comes back to Denmark to create a fixed seven-course meal
        inspired by his trip. Our meal was influenced by Basque
        cuisine, and included tasty tapas, two fish dishes, two
        deserts, and a main course of &quot;sommerbuk,&quot; or
        baby Danish deer. Delicious! The four of us got a bit
        carried away talking about the practice of circumcision
        in America, which provided the surrounding tables with
        free entertainment. No one complained, though, and we
        stuck around until well after the northern sun had set,
        and pedaled back to Helsingor&#146;s train station in the
        dusk, our bellies full to bursting. It had been as close
        to a perfect day as I can remember having in a long time,
        and I only hope to be able to return it in kind some day
        to my wonderful Danish hosts. Thank you Eva, Freddy and
        Niels!</font></p>

        to Copenhagen, 113km</b></font><p><font size="2" face="Arial">I woke up this morning feeling guilty.
        Having taken so many trains of late has seriously
        compromised the integrity of this trip, I thought to
        myself, and I felt I&#146;d given Denmark short shrift,
        pedal-wise. Besides, people told me that I had skipped
        over the prettiest countryside in Seeland by taking the
        train from Vordingborg; and my legs were aching for a
        workout. It was too cold to go to the beach, as Niels had
        formerly proposed, yet too sunny to stay indoors. So I
        took the train back to Vordingborg, promising Niels
        I&#146;d be back in time for dinnner at nine. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The Danes were right. It
        really was a gorgeous ride. I followed the recommended
        and well-marked route #9 (except for the couple of times
        I got lost) and generally enjoyed being alone with the
        hills and trees and wind on my unencumbered bike. I
        passed cows and churches and lots of other bicycle
        tourists. I even saw a pheasant. North of Praesto the
        route followed the coastline of a fjord, which
        didn&#146;t look quite as dramatic as the fjords in
        Norway but was picturesque nevertheless. I dealt with
        virtually zero auto traffic before coming into Koge
        (pronounced as if you&#146;re gargling nails, ignoring
        the second consonant), after which the bike trail
        followed the path of least resistance for some
        kilometers, namely route 151, which traces a straight
        line parallel with the coast through an endless
        suburbo-industrial zone. Thankfully the path turned
        towards the sea to follow a string of islands that looked
        suspiciously like landfill before dumping me back onto
        the 151, where the signs marking the route began to
        dwindle and where I began to get lost in a land of bike
        freeways and apartment blocks that looked like a
        socialist version of Sim City come to life. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">I got to Niels&#146; door
        with just enough time to shower before dinner. Thomas and
        Thomas ate with us, and then Peter and Helle showed up
        with much noisy fanfare. They had just returned from
        making a documentary of a Catholic pilgrimage site in
        Bosnia where several villagers have visions of the Virgin
        Mary every afternoon just before dinnertime. They had
        ridden all the way down in a bus full of Danish pilgrims
        and had many stories to tell. After much laughter and
        many exchanges of &quot;SKOL&quot;&#146;s, I realized I
        had to be up in just a few hours in order to pick up poor
        wounded Fred at the train station. It seemed like an
        eternity that I had last seen him&#133;</font></p>
