        to Marianne, FL, 86 miles</b></font><p><font size="2" face="Arial">And I had always thought that Florida was
        flat as a roadkill armadillo. At our greasy spoon
        breakfast this morning, what appeared to be the village
        idiot came up to us and warned us that our route would be
        hilly all the way to Tallahassee. He said he was a
        cycling enthusiast himself and suggested an alternate
        route along the coast. We didn&#146;t heed his advice
        though, and spent the better part of the day cruising up
        and down the steep hills of the Panhandle.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">We had a tailwind again
        &#150;albeit a considerably lighter one than
        yesterday&#146;s&#151;and we covered the thirty miles to
        De Funiak Springs in no time. This was where our pal
        Geoff&#146;s mom grew up, and we theorized over what
        house could have been her childhood home. The town was
        amazingly cute, full of funky old structures organized
        around a sort of lake. Fred said the place reminded him
        of an episode of &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot;, just as I
        was thinking of the resemblance to the village in Patrick
        McGoohan&#146;s &quot;The Prisoner&quot; --creepy.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">A bit further East we
        encountered love bugs by the millions. Susan had told us
        about them in Pensacola, how they were introduced to eat
        mosquitoes but had become a pest themselves. They&#146;re
        black and fly slowly, always linked in copulating pairs.
        I concentrated on keeping my orifices closed as best I
        could. The drivers, however, were a much worse pest. Most
        of them were cum laude graduates of the Redneck School of
        Driving, and seemed to derive glee from passing us as
        closely as possible, or coming up right beside us before
        leaning into their horns. Fred remarked that Florida has
        the highest b.p.m. (buttheads per mile) ratio of any
        state we&#146;ve ridden in.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">We sought refuge from US
        90 at a Quonset hut restaurant in Ponce de Leon, where
        the lunch special was copious and cheap. When we emerged,
        our tailwind had disintegrated into something resembling
        a headwind. The terrain turned swampier in the lower
        altitudes, and I kept a vigilant eye open for gator
        sightings. Bonifay and Chipley felt especially rednecky
        and threatening; we joked about stopping for an iced
        mocha, but paused only long enough to purchase water at a
        weird Christian service station with slogans all over the
        walls. Further on, what looked like the entire burg of
        Cottondale was being dismantled. All of the buildings
        along the roadside were being either demolished or carted
        away on flatbeds. Was the ground tainted? Or were they
        just planning to widen the road? We&#146;ll never know.
        Marianna soon appeared amidst the towering magnolia
        trees, heralded by rush hour traffic. We landed a sort of
        suite by sweet-talking the granny-owner of our hotel. She
        directed us across the street to Tony&#146;s for some
        truly uninspired Italian cuisine. Tonight I&#146;ll dream
        of the biscuits and grits I&#146;ll be wolfing down at
        breakfast tomorrow. </font></p>

        Tallahassee, FL, 80 miles</b></font><p><font size="2" face="Arial">To be forever known as &quot;I hate Florida
        Day&quot;, this day taught me to have little respect for
        this state. As we rode eastward I daydreamed of the end
        of our voyage in the States and our imminent departure
        for Europe. Anything to keep me from thinking about how
        unfriendly the people are in Florida. I have the distinct
        sensation that the African American folks resent our
        whiteness and the rednecks despise our yankeehood. My
        suspicions were verified by the jeers and catcalls from
        passing drivers of all colors. Cars whizzed by at barely
        subsonic speeds so close we could feel their trim. When
        they weren&#146;t yelling epithets at us they were
        honking and gesticulating. The sheriff of one county even
        tried to run us off the road. Adding to our riding
        experience were the trash strewn road shoulders. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The day was not without
        distraction. On the outskirts of Chatahoochee we came
        across our first of many Floridian correctional
        institutions. It seemed to be surrounded by levies of
        brillo pads. As we rode closer we discovered it was razor
        wire. Our map showed that we could take a shortcut on a
        road that ran close to the prison and we were interested
        in getting a better look. We wanted to take a photo of
        the premises but warning signs advised us not to. As we
        biked the perimeter (against my better judgment) Andy
        goaded me into taking a picture. Without stopping I
        reached into my handlebar bag, turned on the camera,
        lifted it over my head and took two shots. The action did
        not go unnoticed. A mile away from the prison a pick-up
        truck with official markings zinged up to us and rode on
        the grassy shoulder to our right. The shotgun-wielding
        guard advised us that we had been riding close to a
        prison and that we should not have been. Andy started to
        insist that it was a public road. I cut him off and
        started replying with &quot;yessirs&quot; and
        &quot;nosirs&quot;. Spending the day with this type of
        flatfooted buffoon was not what I had in mind.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Coasting into Tallahassee
        was not an option. The terrain was the hilliest we had
        seen since the hill country of Texas. The city was no
        exception; roads laid out in a grid over steep slopes
        made it difficult to shop for a hotel with all of our
        gear aboard. I was especially cranky and ready to be off
        my bike as quickly as possible. Looked all over town for
        a place to rest our heads to no avail. Finally we decided
        to eat. Popeye&#146;s across from the rescue mission gave
        us an opportunity to collect some nourishment before
        reinitiating our search. We shopped with our stomachs,
        sampling the complimentary chocolate chip cookies at
        several hotels. Finally settling on one that had been
        decorated by an iron curtain era designer. When we
        reached our room we realized that the sliding glass door
        had been sealed by the hotel. One of the benefits of
        traveling with enough tools to disassemble a bicycle is
        that we can correct this type of problem. After my minor
        hotel remodeling job we proceeded to update our website
        in the newly fresh air.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Afterwards we decided to
        hit the town for a drink. We got into the cab cautiously
        when I noticed there was no meter. When the driver quoted
        us $10 for a ten block trip I bargained with my feet,
        opening the door and getting out. Quickly backpedaling
        our driver corrected himself saying that was for a
        two-way trip, further demonstrating the sleaziness of
        Floridians. The bar, called &quot;Brothers&quot; was a
        bust, too. We had gone anticipating viewing fictitious
        Ellen becoming a lesbian on t.v. in the company of some
        simpatico homo brethren, but the bar wasn&#146;t showing
        it. There wasn&#146;t a single sister to be found at
        Brothers, which Susan had told us was Tallahassee&#146;s
        one and only queer bar. All we found were a few
        scary-looking alkies slumped over the bar. An admitted
        former heroin addict from New York asked Andy if he
        wanted to step outside to taste some moonshine that he
        had stashed there. We took this as our cue to return to
        our hotel, where I was soon dreaming of our arrival on
        the east coast.</font></p>

        way out of town we thought of the &quot;village
        idiot&quot; back in Marianna, who had told us the terrain
        would flatten out East of the capital. We postulated that
        he had never been East of Tallahassee, which he&#146;d
        visited only once, to pay the back taxes due on his
        trailer. The road we followed was unquestionably the
        prettiest one we&#146;d been on in a long while. It was
        called Old St. Augustine Rd. (which made us feel like we
        were nearing our goal, plus heading in the right
        direction) and was self-billed as a &quot;canopy
        road&quot;, meaning that the long branches of live oaks
        and other trees had all but engulfed it entirely. The
        best part of all, though, was the utter lack of traffic,
        which we were to enjoy for the remainder of our extremely
        long day of riding. Fred kept turning to me and saying
        that he was beginning to like Florida again, against his
        better judgment.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">At our lunch stop we met a
        family who was very curious about our travels. We
        answered their many questions and learned that they were
        in the process of moving to Oklahoma. The dad was a
        fossil hunter, and told us that if we got into any kind
        of trouble we should go to a church. He told us his
        favorite flavor of church, too, and I wondered for a
        moment if his and his family&#146;s enthusiasm had an
        agenda behind it. When we complained about all the
        rednecks in the Panhandle, his response was: &quot;Just
        consider yourselves lucky you&#146;re not riding through
        Georgia; it&#146;s much worse there.&quot; I told him
        we&#146;d seen &quot;Deliverance&quot; and thought to
        myself that the Sunshine State wasn&#146;t looking so bad
        after all.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">After following a series
        of beautifully abandoned back roads, we hooked up with
        the 90 again near Greenville, where we were surprised to
        find a shoulder and a dearth of auto traffic. In a sleepy
        old town called Madison we stopped at a pharmacy and soda
        fountain for root beer floats and a routing pow-wow.
        Several logistical factors made us decide to head towards
        Jacksonville rather than St. Augustine. Our goal for the
        evening shifted from a campground on the Suwannee River
        to a motel some twenty-five miles further down the road,
        making me wonder if we&#146;d ever find a use for all the
        camping gear we&#146;ve been lugging along.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The sun had nearly set by
        the time we reached the cluster of highway culture at
        exit 84 of Interstate 75. We were exhausted, sweaty and
        encrusted in road dirt and dead bugs, so my attempt at
        bargaining for a better room rate was especially feeble.
        When I saw the sign outside proclaiming the motel as
        &quot;American Owned&quot; I was prepared to deal with a
        redneck, yet inside was another friendly Indian
        gentleman, who told me that he was just filling in for
        his friend and that the owner was indeed American. I
        wanted to ask him how he felt about the racist,
        xenophobic sign outside, but my desire to get under a
        shower was too strong.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The nearby &quot;3
        B&#146;s&quot; (we never did ask what the b&#146;s stood
        for) looked like your basic roadside diner, but the food
        was surprisingly good. You could tell that someone in the
        kitchen actually gave a damn about what s/he put on the
        customers&#146; plates. We both needed to carboload after
        such a long day of riding, and devoured our plates of
        pasta like wolves. The beverage selection was more
        disappointing, however. When I ordered a beer, the
        waitress insisted on my proof of age, which I had left
        behind in the room. No problem, I said, just bring me an
        O&#146;Doul&#146;s beer-flavored non-alcoholic beverage.
        When she said I&#146;d need an ID for that, too, I nearly
        lost it; but Fred placated me into settling for a big
        cool glass of water. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Not much later, I fell
        asleep giddy with the thought that we&#146;d be finished
        with our transcontinental journey in less than
        twenty-four hours. </font></p>

        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Our Indian friend from the
        front desk of the hotel burst into our room a few times
        in the morning as we were preparing to get an early start
        for Jacksonville. Each time he said &quot;ooh, sorry,
        wrong room!&quot; As we were actually leaving he dashed
        in again, frantically looking for something and caught us
        as we were getting on our bikes. &quot;Did you leave the
        key?,&quot; he asked. Andy and I looked at one another
        trying to remember who had the key last (this was not the
        first time we had walked away with the key). Each of us
        looking at the other more and more confidently, trying to
        intimidate the other into digging through panniers to
        find the key. I finally fessed-up to having it last and
        rifled through and found it.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Breakfast was at the
        3-B&#146;s again. There was a table full of waitresses
        from the night before and one was with her girlfriend. We
        were both amazed at how many rural lesbians there are in
        the U.S. who seem to be out, happy and accepted in their
        communities. Andy was still grumbling about the beer
        episode the night before. He finally calmed down after a
        few cups of coffee. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The first part of the
        riding day was great. Warm morning sun, wide road, little
        traffic, big shoulder and exquisite scenery. Crossing the
        foliage-encrusted Suwannee River we got into the groove
        for last day of riding in the states. The splendor faded
        gradually as we headed for America&#146;s largest city
        (824 square miles).</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">We knew that we were in
        the capital of white trashdom and redneckdom as we
        pedaled past a business called &quot;Repo City&quot; that
        specialized in reselling repossessed trailer homes.
        Cringing and laughing at the same time upon seeing the
        signs that boasted &quot;E-Z terms&quot;, &quot;No money
        down&quot; and, the especially ironic - &quot;No credit
        check&quot;.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">We were riding through
        what was signed as a National Forest. Nestled in the
        National Forest were five more correctional institutions.
        We mused about what Florida should consider changing its
        tagline to. We imagined them supplanting &quot;The
        Sunshine State&quot; with &quot;The incarceration
        state&quot;. The &quot;National Forest&quot; was a sham,
        behind the rows of trees that had been left along the
        road there were acres and acres of land that had been
        clear cut. Occasionally we came across groves of trees
        that had been spared. Near one of those groves we saw a
        tortoise on the opposite shoulder contemplating crossing
        the road. In horror Andrew sped across the road, picked
        up the wayward creature and relocated him back to the
        grove.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Not long after this good
        deed we road into McClenny, nearly the last town before
        the sprawl of Jacksonville. The main streets were
        perpendicular to the small highway we were riding on and
        were devoid of any lunching opportunities. We
        couldn&#146;t figure out where the folks in a town of
        over 10K were eating. We finally ran into a couple who
        had been stranded in the town for a few days while their
        car was being repaired. The looked like they were
        incarcerated, very sullen, very sad and very fed up with
        being in McClenny. They pointed us down a side street
        that led to the new center of the town that had grown up
        around the WalMart. There we hit paydirt, ate lunch and
        hit the trail.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">The next miles were not as
        interesting as the last. The terrain became more and more
        urban. The shoulder became narrower with each mile. The
        traffic became heavier. Gradually the riding experience
        became more and more hellish. By the time we reached
        downtown Jacksonville we were ready to forego the
        Atlantic Coast Bike-at-the-beach vanity shot. We
        persevered and rode onward. Motorists became ruder and
        ruder, coming closer and closer as they passed. Finally
        we elected to take a lane on the narrow road and that is
        when all hell broke lose. As we approached a signal an
        impatient female motorist came up behind us and laid on
        her horn. Then a bearded dude in a very fancy pickup
        truck lost his temper and tried to run us off the road.
        He nearly clipped me but only brushed my front pannier. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">I lost my temper and so
        did Andy. I saw a cop in the gas station on the corner
        and sped off to explain what had happened. Andy berated
        the bozo through the window of his truck. As I told the
        cop the story he started to tell me there was nothing he
        would or could do. Just then a woman who had seen the
        whole event unfold rolled into the station and started to
        tell the officer what had happened. He still said there
        was nothing to be done. I wouldn&#146;t settle for that,
        the driver had intentionally tried to hit me. I told the
        officer that I wanted to press charges for assault with a
        deadly weapon. With that he called his supervisor, who
        instructed him to write a Hit and Run citation. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">That wasn&#146;t the last
        redneck run-in that afternoon, either. Looking back on
        it, Jacksonville has to be the most dangerous urban area
        we&#146;d ridden through during the trip. We rode slowly
        and carefully to the coast. After winding through coastal
        residential neighborhoods we found ourselves at Neptune
        Beach. The excitement of seeing the sand was too much; it
        signified the end of this leg of the trip. It also meant
        the end of riding with rednecks. We dragged our bikes
        down the beach and into the water coerced some little
        passerby to take the photo and were ready to seek a hotel
        when we met Robert.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">Robert is too large a
        character to describe. Novels are based on people with
        this big of a personality. He is the uncle of Will, the
        boy who took our photo. Wade, Will&#146;s brother, and
        Robert came up to us just after Will snapped our picture
        in the sand. Robert was from Massachusetts, lived for
        years in California and now in Neptune beach with
        &quot;his Woman, Peggy.&quot; We knew this and more
        within two minutes of introduction. Before we knew it we
        were having a beer and watching the sunset on
        Robert&#146;s porch overlooking the Atlantic musing about
        our trip and learning Robert&#146;s life history while he
        apologized to Peggy for bringing home strangers again.
        Model, filmmaker, boat restorer, clothing manufacturer,
        professional kickboxer, amateur artist and professional
        bullshitter were among his past and present careers.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Arial">We escaped (narrowly) to
        our hotel down the beach, but not without promising to
        come back the next day to share our bottle of champagne
        that somehow ended up in Robert&#146;s fridge. On the way
        to the hotel we couldn&#146;t help but think how great
        America is and how nowhere else in the world could breed
        people like Robert, as well as our friends in Sanderson,
        Allen and Amy from Pensacola and all the other wonderful,
        wild and weird cast of characters we&#146;d met along our
        route. We cast aside sentimentality and were soon
        stuffing our faces at the copious seafood buffet of our
        hotel, wondering how Europe would compare to the U.S.</font></p>
