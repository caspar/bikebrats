    <td><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="2"><b>25 July, Hanoi to Hoa Binh, 98km(a)</b><p>Drizzle. It
    does wonders for keeping a bikebrat cool in this climate, but certainly doesn&#146;t keep
    him clean. By the end of our ride today our bikes and we were filthier than I can ever
    remember us being.</p>
    <p>It was exciting to look out our window at five this morning and seeing the stuff
    falling, though. Has the rainy season arrived here, spelling a (temporary) end to the
    blistering heat? We woke Wendy to bid her adieu, and she waved us off as we rode into the
    mist. As always, it was great to witness an Asian town waking up. <i>Cyclos</i> carted
    coal used for cooking; women bearing twin baskets of vegetables trotted along with their
    yokes and cone-shaped hats; kids played soccer and badminton in the middle of busy
    streets, undeterred by the traffic. I was going to miss Hanoi &#150;its unique energy and
    charm, our fantastically homey room in the colonial-era Hoa Binh hotel, and having spunky
    Wendy as our traveling companion. </p>
    <p>Getting out of town was painless. The busy boulevard feeding into highway 6 featured a
    special parallel street for bicycles and oxcarts, offering some refuge from the constant
    honking of motorbikes and trucks. It was difficult, though, to go any faster than the
    slow-moving current of bicycles that we were a part of. I was delighted to see bikes
    bearing pigs &#150;both live and butchered&#151;and noticed that Fred&#146;s back was a
    mud-splattered mess. As we penetrated the infinite expanse of rice fields, he told me I
    looked no better. We vowed to seek out fenders later in the day.</p>
    <p>Rising out of the paddies about twenty kilometers out of town was an unusual sight: a
    huge French-style cathedral without so much as a hamlet around it. We did some
    hit-and-miss riding along irrigation canals in order to reach the place, and were beckoned
    to the rear of the massive church to the monastery. A man (perhaps a plainclothes priest)
    unlocked the door for me, and I was surprised to see that the place was still in use. Who
    came here to pray? What was this huge place of worship doing in the middle of nowhere?
    These are questions that do not figure in our phrasebook, so I never learned their
    answers. I did find &quot;how old is it?&quot; which our friend answered by dipping his
    finger in a glass of tea he&#146;d served us and writing &quot;100&quot; on the long
    wooden table which lay between us. Other gawkers came and filled the doorway to the
    refectory, but little communication occurred. </p>
    <p>When we left after three or four cups of excellent tea, the drizzle had turned to light
    rain. The traffic thinned out as we headed west through increasingly dramatic scenery.
    Somehow the road managed to take us gradually up into the lumpy mountainscape, and before
    long we were enjoying a gentle descent through a valley of dreamlike beauty. We reached
    Hoa Binh (which means &quot;peace&quot;) well before noon, but it took us a while to
    decide on a place to stay. After a bizarre episode in a cheaper place we had pedaled back
    to, we settled on the most expensive hotel in town, primarily for its peaceful rural
    location far from the honking horns of highway 6 and the droning propaganda speakers which
    pollute the air of the town center. </p>
    <p>After a good long scrub, we ate lunch with a pair of French women we met while scoping
    out a restaurant. They had been touring the region for a few days in a private car and
    this was the spot that their driver recommended. We were shocked to find the menu
    translated into English, and the friendly Thai owner kept sitting down at our table and
    forcing us to use the nine words we know in her native language. The food was delicious
    and we promised we&#146;d be back for dinner.</p>
    <p>Next on our agenda was finding fenders. We pulled into the first bike shop we found
    (they&#146;re literally everywhere in this most bike-friendly of countries) and within
    instants several shirtless guys were jury-rigging plastic fenders onto my front and rear
    wheels. Fred decided to wait for something more specifically suited to our bikes, but with
    the misshapen things already attached to mine, I was hardly in a position to refuse.</p>
    <p>We pedaled along a dike holding back the mighty Da River (the biggest of the Red
    River&#146;s tributaries) out to the dam we had read about, the largest in Vietnam.
    Nothing in the guidebook had prepared me for the actual sight of the thing. Built on a
    gargantuan scale, it&#146;s one of the few objects I&#146;ve ever witnessed that has put
    me in utter awe of what our species is capable of accomplishing. An enormous spillway,
    through which a frighteningly powerful torrent of water gushes downwards and outwards,
    dominates one side of it. Fred and I spent the better part of an hour staring in
    gape-jawed wonder at this, and then set off to circumnavigate the dam. First, of course,
    we had to climb the thing. The view from the top was dramatic enough to make us wish
    we&#146;d brought our camera. We continued on past various megabuildings associated with
    the project before swooping back down to river level, where we found a large and tasteful
    (surprising in tack-loving Vietnam) monument to the people killed by the behemoth. We
    bought incense sticks from an enterprising young woman and placed one in each porcelain
    jar associated with a memorial stone. This took a long time, for there were nearly two
    hundred of them, lots of Ng&#146;s and Nguyen&#146;s, plus exactly eleven Russians. </p>
    <p>We pedaled through a special bicycle tunnel under the spillway itself to get back to
    our room and a nap. When we woke a couple of hours later, neither of us could find the
    wherewithal to bike back into town for dinner, so we dined on power bars before turning in
    at 10 p.m. We&#146;ll possibly never know what Hoa Binh offers in the way of entertainment
    on a Saturday night.</font></td>

    <p>26 July, Hoa Binh to Ninh Binh, 127km (f)</b></p>
    <p>Getting up before dawn and riding with the first light has become second nature. This
    morning was no exception. Thankfully the sky was gray-silver and filled with clouds
    thwarting the sun&#146;s best efforts to overheat us. We chugged up a steep incline for
    the first 20 kilometers past women hauling produce and villagers pushing bicycles while
    overburdened scooters and trucks smoked past us. Finding our way was again a challenge.
    Locals have long been accustomed to sending tourists to the &quot;tourist resort&quot; of
    Mai Chau nearby, sort of a human zoo for hill tribe people. Each person we asked had to be
    told five, ten and sometimes fifteen times that we are not going there. Andy nearly lost
    his temper during at least one of these exchanges and was visibly flustered when we ask
    for directions. Our pace and path allow us to see &quot;real&quot; hill tribes going about
    their daily affairs like cultivating rice and grazing their cattle. They jeered and
    shouted at us as we passed.</p>
    <p>After the ascent I looked down at Hoa Binh and was amazed at how far we&#146;d climbed.
    We dove into a high valley and rolled along in it, awing at the dramatic verdant
    landscapes. After our strenuous climb we lunched at a crossroads where there was an
    exceedingly popular market. So crowded it was hard to pedal down the street. Traditional
    garb was all the rage -- pants flared outward at the bottoms and tunic shirts. Salty <i>pho</i>
    satisfied our hunger before we pressed on through what was one of the most beautiful rice
    filled valleys I&#146;d seen since Indonesia. </p>
    <p>At one drink stop I fell into a deep sleep on a bench while Andy watched a French
    version of a Jacques Cousteau video on VTV (Vietnamese Television). The road had
    deteriorated into little stones mortared together with mud. Bone jarring dips spotted our
    path and numbed my hands. The already ailing Connie the Compaq Computer can&#146;t be
    liking all this abuse (nor can Siegfried and Roy). Andy baled water from a well at one
    stop and we poured the cold water over each other&#146;s heads. The road became paved, the
    scenery more dramatic with sugarloaf mountain-like formations rising from the rice paddy.
    Soon we turned right onto the Transvietnamese highway with the sea of humanity on all
    modes of transport flanking us.</p>
    <p>Scooterbound hotel hawkers tried to convince us to stay at their hotels but we elected
    to stay at the big, dirty and ugly commie hotel, the Hoa Lu. I met a pair of female French
    travellers in the lobby, one of whom had spent the bulk of her vacation in hospitals in
    Danang and Hanoi. At a guesthouse we ate a meal, meeting a pair of burnt British girls and
    a pair of Frogs who live in Shanghai. I could barely make it through the meal I was so
    rattled from our ride. We retreated to our filthy bedbug ridden commie hotel and passed
    into a coma.</font></td>

  <tr>
    <td><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="2"><b>28 July, Ninh Binh to Haiphong/Hon Gai, 119km (a)</b><p>Today
    we crossed the Red River delta, one of the most populated places on Earth &#150;a fact
    that was hard to forget as we crossed the people-filled plain.</p>
    <p>Yesterday&#146;s &quot;rest day&quot; in Ninh Binh went by all too quickly (as rest
    days have an annoying tendency to do). We spent the greater part of it cycling out to Tam
    Coc, the region&#146;s principal tourist attraction, where we were treated to yet another
    sweaty rowboat ride through intensely beautiful scenery. We foolishly elected to take
    another route back to town, along unimproved roads and tracks. While it was interesting to
    see the primitive conditions in which most Vietnamese live, my butt didn&#146;t need
    another beating after the abuse I subjected it to the previous day. </p>
    <p>This morning we got an extra-early start, having convinced the hotel to have breakfast
    ready for us an hour before regular operating hours. Our bellies full of yesterday&#146;s
    stale baguettes, we rode out of Ninh Binh in the dawn drizzle, plowing past <i>cyclos</i>,
    oxcarts and clouds of slow-moving bicycles. A Vietnamese guy we met in a backpackers café
    yesterday told us that the road to Haiphong was &quot;bad, very very bad&quot; so we were
    expecting the worst. But in actuality it was all right &#150;a little bumpy perhaps, but
    at least it was paved, straight, and flat as a board. </p>
    <p>We made good time to Nam Dinh, 29 kilometers away. The town came as somewhat of a
    surprise after the rural aspect of the road. The place was hugely crowded, bursting at the
    seams with teeming humanity, Asia at its most intense. Somehow we made it through the mess
    (basically a giant bicycle jam) and out to the ferry that would take us across the Red
    River&#146;s main branch. Since demand for this decrepit old ferry far exceeds capacity,
    we had to dig in our heels and wait while seven thousand pairs of eyes focused on us and
    us alone. Fortunately a tall, intellectual-looking local took us under his wing and helped
    us schmooze our way to the head of the line. He said he was on his way to nearby Thai Binh
    but spent most of his time in Brussels. </p>
    <p>Thai Binh is another huge Red River delta town. Our route fortunately skirted around
    the center, allowing us to admire from a distance the big Spanish-style church dominating
    the city&#146;s skyline.</p>
    <p>We made a beverage stop on the way out of town, gulping down many liters of liquids and
    using the newly-installed bathroom facilities that were obviously the owner&#146;s pride
    and joy (he insisted on providing us with clean towels and gave us a detailed tour of the
    sparkling clean plumbing). Though I&#146;ve grown used to it over the past several months,
    I still find it amusing to walk through someone&#146;s house &#150;the kitchen, the
    bedrooms&#151;in order to use the toilet (which is invariably located in the back yard
    with the chickens, the laundry). It allows an intimate glimpse of how these people live.
    Usually there&#146;s someone crouched over a cooking fire, a couple of kids playing on the
    cement floor and a grandparent asleep in a cot in the corner. How do Asians manage to make
    so many kids with such an utter lack of privacy? </p>
    <p>A glancing tailwind blew us the next fifty kilometers to a crossroads at Vinh Bao. A
    sign indicated a shorter route to Haiphong to the right; but having a rich experience in
    failed shortcuts, we proceeded with caution. Miraculously a young shopkeeper approached us
    and started speaking in perfectly pronounced German. He said he had lived in Germany
    before (presumably the eastern part) and that the shortcut was definitely the way to go.
    Though my German is limited at best, I understood that the road was well-surfaced, that we
    should turn left over the second bridge and that there would be a ferry. After so many
    weeks of making futile attempts at sign language, it felt great to be communicating
    verbally again. </p>
    <p>We did well by taking the shortcut, which turned out to be an absolute dream of a road.
    A narrow ribbon of asphalt running alongside a canal and carrying only bicycle and foot
    traffic, it wouldn&#146;t have looked out of place in Holland. During this bucolic 28-km
    pedal into town Fred developed his theory that Vietnamese &#150;at least those living in
    this crowded region&#151;are actually Smurfs. Supporting evidence included the miniature
    houses and boats, and the generally diminutive (not to mention friendly and fun-loving)
    nature of the people. Whatever the case, it felt wonderful to be away from truck horns,
    the only sounds being those of children playing, ducks quacking, creaky old bicycles
    pedaling along, and the ceaseless roar of the wind. If only all our routes were like
    this&#133;</p>
    <p>At one point we passed a one-legged man pedaling furiously. He blew us both away by
    keeping up with us for several kilometers, beaming proudly all the while. Another guy we
    saw was pushing a bike so heavily-laden with eel traps that it looked like a moving
    mountain of wicker rolling down the road. </p>
    <p>Our second ferry of the day was even more crowded than the first, with no effete
    Brussels-dweller to buffer us from the teeming, curious masses. We had to fight tooth and
    nail for a tiny spot at the rear of the boat, jammed against motorbikes bearing crabs,
    pedaling ice cream vendors and yolk-carrying peasants of every stripe. Not long after
    landing on the other side we were lost in the tree-shaded labyrinth of Haiphong,
    Vietnam&#146;s third- or fourth- largest city, depending on whom you ask. With more than
    the usual communications difficulties, we managed to find the port and book passage to Hon
    Gai, also known as Halong City. </p>
    <p>The following two-and-a-half-hours unquestionably constitute the best three-dollar
    cruise I&#146;ve ever taken. Standing on the bow of a boat in the golden hours before
    sunset is always a magical experience for me, and doing so among the dreamlike islands of
    Halong Bay touches on the sublime. </p>
    <p>Hon Gai is much more spectacularly situated than its more touristed neighbor, Bai Chay
    (a.k.a. Halong City West), where we had been with Wendy precisely one week earlier. For
    one thing, it is set right amidst the karst formations for which Halong Bay is famous. But
    perhaps more picturesque is the substantial floating village which clogs the harbor. Boats
    &#150;most of them oar-powered&#151; glide this way and that, bearing all manner of goods,
    animals and people. The town itself is like a miniature Hong Kong, jam-packed and oriented
    vertically towards the mountains and the sky. </p>
    <p>After two nights in a shithole, our lodgings in Hon Gai feel like a major coup. It is
    our first accommodation in Vietnam calling itself a &quot;mini hotel&quot; --an
    appropriate moniker given the postage-stamp sized towel, the Lilliputian furniture and the
    $13 price tag. Included in this rate is a drop-dead gorgeous view of Halong Bay, which we
    were able to appreciate for all of five minutes before darkness fell. As I write these
    notes, I&#146;m hoping Fred won&#146;t rustle me downstairs before dawn tomorrow so I can
    get another peek.</font></td>

    <p>Bathe me!</td>
    <td><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="2"><b>29 July, Hon Gai to Tien Yen/Mong Cai, 92km (f)</b><p>I&#146;d
    slept restlessly, with dreams of lost passports disturbing my sleep. Vietnamese hotel
    operators are absolutely crazy for your travel papers. They so badly want to hold them
    hostage so that you won&#146;t run off with their sheets and towels. They all claim that
    the &quot;police&quot; must see them, but I have yet to see any hotel personnel run them
    to the station house. What they do is copy some information onto little slips of paper and
    then lock them in a drawer, press them into a notebook or use them as drink coasters in
    the hotel lounge. Normally we insist on having them the night before we leave a place, but
    on this occasion we were unable to persuade the management to give them to us, thus
    inspiring my dreams. After a breakfast of yogurt, mangos and Cliff Bars while staring at
    the most spectacular view from any hotel that I&#146;ve ever stayed in, we hit the road.</p>
    <p>We had to contend with a surprising amount of traffic as we made our way to the Chinese
    border. Huge trucks full of coal fought tour busses for space on the road. The tourists,
    largely Vietnamese, were on their way to the border town&#146;s free trade zone to buy
    cheap Chinese goods. Soon after leaving Hon Gai the road and the houses lining it turned
    to coal-dust gray. From the palette we could have easily been in Belgium. The people were
    gray as well. We passed a threesome of children that were so dirty it was hard to
    distinguish them from the anthracite dust itself. We could hardly criticize their hygiene,
    as we were both sporting black skunk stripes down our backs and a thick layer of coal dust
    had adhered to our sweat-covered bodies. When we stopped for drinks the locals were amused
    by our ragtag appearance. When we could look past the gray road undistracted by the busses
    and trucks we saw the rounded limestone hills covered by thick green foliage.</p>
    <p>It felt as though we had already passed out of Vietnam. The people seemed far less
    refined. In all other parts of the country even the poorest peasants seem somehow
    civilized. This day their shouts from the roadside seemed vulgar and obnoxious. When we
    reached Tien Yen --our intended day&#146;s destination-- we were unable even to eat our
    midday meal in peace. The restaurant&#146;s staff occupied the tables around us, pointing
    and laughing at us while we tried to eat. A visit to the only hotel in town revealed a
    shockingly dirty and overpriced hellhole. I voted to continue on to Mong Cai by bike or
    bus and Andy grudgingly agreed. We would have stayed had the villagers been nice or the
    town charming, but neither seemed so. After a half-hour wait (during which a handful of
    locals poked, prodded, pinched and petted us in awe) we were on a bus. Our bikes were
    secured up top and we were underway to the border after riding nearly 100 kilometers in
    the blazing sun. The bus itself was not one for tourists. It was filled with peasants,
    many of whom had been on the tiny thing since Hanoi. At times it seemed that the crew
    (there were at least five) and the passengers were a family; they displayed such
    familiarity. Just before we reached Mong Cai all available space seemed to fill with
    giggling girls who stared and laughed at us for the best part of a half-hour.</p>
    <p>Mong Cai was hardly more beautiful than Tien Yen. The big dusty cement market town had
    the appearance of being built yesterday. Getting off the bus we were greeted by twenty
    motorcycle taxi drivers vying for our business despite the fact we had our own
    transportation. They stood in our way as tried to load our bikes and press onward. Other
    &quot;helpful&quot; types rode along side of us as we toured town hawking hotel rooms. In
    the end a Chinese-Vietnamese businessman helped us find comfortable lodgings and we
    settled in before seeking a pre-dinner BikeBrat snack of ice cream.</p>
    <b><p>Vietnam, epilogue (f)</b></p>
    <p>Dust, dirt, inhospitable surroundings, brusque people, average food all hosted in an
    ugly town. This seemed a weird way to end our stay in Vietnam and at odds with the rest of
    the visit. I wondered if this was what lay ahead of us in China fearing the worst. Mong
    Cai was a disgusting hell-hole, but our visit to Vietnam was probably our most interesting
    one in Asia to date. Part of the appeal was that Vietnam was new to both of us and neither
    of us had any idea what to expect, except the worst as we were warned by other travelers
    and our guidebook.</p>
    <p>Our last hotel in Vietnam was hardly worth remembering except that it encapsulated two
    favorite pastimes of the Vietnamese: karaoke and cavorting with whores. I was certain the
    wailing sounds of the former would drown out the cries of the latter. There were at least
    three karaoke rooms that had windows on the same airshaft as our room. The songs mingled
    and echoed, rendering sound concoctions that ranged from horror movie soundtracks to dogs
    copulating.</p>
    <p>Somehow through all the dust, dirt, dinge and Chinese influence there was some essence
    of the Vietnam I&#146;d come to like. Curious kids uninhibited by our strangeness still
    approached, bustling market fringed with cafés beckoned and friendly folks of all sorts
    greeted us. I was truly sad to be leaving Vietnam and was counting the days until I might
    return. Perhaps we will have to ride from Saigon through Cambodia afterall?!</font></td>
